## Why P1

Can't manage governance in-app without editing. Currently requires switching to a text editor.

## Tasks

- [ ] CodeMirror 6 editor component for markdown/YAML editing
- [ ] Edit mode toggle on artifact viewers (view -> edit)
- [ ] Create new artifact from template (agents, rules, skills, hooks)
- [ ] Delete artifact with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Wire artifact store methods to backend CRUD commands
