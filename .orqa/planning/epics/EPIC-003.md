description: >
  Add fallback context injection when SDK session resume fails due to
  app restart or cleared storage.
tags: [session, resume, context]

## Why P1

Can't restart the app during development without losing conversation context. Every Rust change requires a restart, so this directly blocks dogfooding workflow.

## Tasks

- [ ] Detect SDK resume failure in sidecar (returned session_id !== passed session_id)
- [ ] Sidecar emits `context_needed` event to Rust
- [ ] Rust loads last ~20 text messages from SQLite for the session
- [ ] Rust sends `context_history` to sidecar for injection
- [ ] Rust emits `ContextInjected` event for transparency (EPIC-001)
