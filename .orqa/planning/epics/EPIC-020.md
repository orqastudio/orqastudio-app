## Tasks

- [ ] Research artifact type — structured, queryable, filterable
- [ ] Decision traceability graph (research -> AD -> feature -> implementation)
- [ ] Research-to-AD promotion workflow
- [ ] Discovery dashboard — open questions, pending decisions
- [ ] Conversational research workflow — Claude-assisted investigation producing structured artifacts
