## Why P2

465 Rust tests exist but zero frontend tests. Changes to stores break components silently. This is a learning gap — without tests, regression patterns can't be detected.

## Tasks

- [ ] Vitest setup for Svelte component and store testing
- [ ] Store unit tests (conversation, session, project, settings — state transitions, reactive updates)
- [ ] Component tests for critical UI (ConversationView, ToolApprovalDialog, SessionDropdown)
- [ ] IPC contract tests — verify invoke calls match actual Tauri commands

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
