## Why P1

Implementation cannot begin without knowing the data model, the IPC surface, and the module boundaries. This phase converts the architecture decisions and UX design into implementable specifications.

## What Was Done

- SQLite schema — all tables, columns, indexes, and foreign key constraints
- IPC command catalogue — every Tauri command with its input/output types
- Rust module architecture — domain boundaries, service interfaces, repository pattern
- Svelte component tree — component hierarchy mapped to the UX wireframes
- Streaming pipeline — Agent SDK to Svelte event flow, Channel<T> protocol
- Tool definitions — file tools, search tools, governance tools with permission model
- MCP host interface — design for future external MCP server support
- Error taxonomy — typed errors across the Rust/IPC/TypeScript boundary

## Output

All technical design documentation in `.orqa/documentation/architecture/`.

## Notes

Retroactively captured. Work preceded the artifact framework. These specifications are the source of truth for all implementation.

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
