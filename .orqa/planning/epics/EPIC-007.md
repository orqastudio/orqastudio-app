## Why P2

Code health for sustained velocity. Functions individually pass size limits, but file-level cohesion is poor. This is about practicing what we preach — composability is a platform principle.

## Tasks

- [ ] Extract `StreamOrchestrator` from `stream_commands.rs` (2,232 lines -> command handlers + orchestrator service)
- [ ] Implement `Tool` trait and `ToolRegistry` from `tool_executor.rs` (966 lines -> pluggable tools)
- [ ] Decompose `ConversationView.svelte` (367 lines) into smaller composable units if complexity grows
- [ ] Service layer for enforcement, governance, and scanning (wrap procedural code in structs)

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
