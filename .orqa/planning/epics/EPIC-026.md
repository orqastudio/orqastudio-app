## Why P1

Architecture decisions are the governing law of the codebase. Every implementation agent must comply with them. Without these decisions, implementation is ungoverned.

## What Was Done

- AD-007 through AD-017 recorded in `docs/architecture/decisions.md`
- Decisions cover: sidecar integration pattern, streaming pipeline design, security model, MCP host approach, persistence strategy, governance format, composability principle
- Each decision includes context, the decision made, consequences, and status

## Output

`docs/architecture/decisions.md` — the authoritative record of all architecture decisions.

## Notes

Retroactively captured. Work preceded the artifact framework. These decisions remain active and govern all subsequent implementation.

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.

## Tasks

Task breakdown to be defined.
