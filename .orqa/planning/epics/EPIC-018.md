  Build agent registry, spawn_agent tool, explore mode, output
  aggregation, and turn limits for sub-agent delegation.
tags: [agents, sub-agents, delegation]

## Tasks

- [ ] Agent registry — reads `.orqa/agents/*.md`, indexes capabilities
- [ ] `spawn_agent` tool — spawns sub-agent with role and instructions
- [ ] Explore mode — lightweight codebase exploration agent (no tool approval)
- [ ] Output aggregation — child tool calls collected, summary card with expandable detail
- [ ] Turn limits — configurable max turns per sub-agent invocation
