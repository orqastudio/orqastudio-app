description: >
  Add a project type system so OrqaStudio adapts its agents, tools,
  and scanning to the domain (software, research, product, personal).
tags: [project-types, domain-agnostic]

## Why P1

Without this, non-software users encounter software-specific features that don't apply to them. Domain-agnostic thinking is a core principle.

## Tasks

- [ ] `project_type` field in `.orqa/project.json` and `ProjectSettings` — Software, Research, Product, Personal, Custom
- [ ] Project type determines which agents, tools, and scanning are available
- [ ] Software projects get code tools (ChunkHound, file tools, git); others get domain-appropriate tooling
- [ ] Non-software projects work without requiring a codebase
- [ ] Project type selector in project creation/settings
