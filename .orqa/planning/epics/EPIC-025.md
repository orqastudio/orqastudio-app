## Why P1

All subsequent phases depend on these decisions. No architecture decisions, product definition, or scaffold can begin without knowing the tech stack.

## What Was Done

- Claude integration research — evaluated Agent SDK sidecar architecture for conversation management
- Tauri v2 capability audit — confirmed Tauri v2 meets desktop app requirements (security model, IPC, plugin ecosystem)
- Frontend library selection — evaluated and selected Svelte 5 with shadcn-svelte
- Persistence design — evaluated SQLite via rusqlite for structured local storage
- Onboarding strategy — defined approach for first-run project setup and Claude authentication

## Output

All research findings documented in `.orqa/planning/research/`.

## Notes

Retroactively captured. Work preceded the artifact framework.

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.

## Tasks

Task breakdown to be defined.
