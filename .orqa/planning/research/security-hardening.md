  Audit and restriction of Tauri capabilities: remove overly broad fs, shell,
  dialog, and notification permissions. Enable Content Security Policy. Replace
  with minimum required permissions.

## Problem

The initial scaffold used broad default permissions (`fs:default`, `shell:default`,
`dialog:default`, `notification:default`) for rapid development. These grant more
access than the app needs, increasing attack surface.

## Audit Findings

- **fs plugin** — Unused by frontend. All file I/O goes through custom Rust commands via `invoke()`
- **shell plugin** — Unused by frontend. Process spawning uses `std::process::Command` in Rust
- **dialog plugin** — Only `dialog:allow-open` is used (file picker for project icon)
- **notification plugin** — Unused entirely

## Changes

- Removed: `fs:default`, `shell:default`, `dialog:default`, `notification:default`
- Added: `dialog:allow-open` (minimum required)
- Enabled: Content Security Policy

## Relationship to AD-011

This hardening implements the security model described in AD-011 more strictly.
The initial scaffold was intentionally permissive for development speed; this
sprint tightened it for dogfooding.

## Git Evidence

- `71838b4` — Restrict Tauri capabilities and enable CSP
