title: "Local embeddings and semantic search"
description: >
  Adds on-device embedding generation using an ONNX model with GPU acceleration,
  enabling semantic similarity search that ranks results by cosine distance.

acceptance:
  - ONNX Runtime loads bge-small-en-v1.5 model
  - DirectML acceleration works (GPU/NPU with CPU fallback)
  - Semantic search returns results ranked by cosine similarity

## What

Add ONNX-based embedding generation and semantic (vector similarity) search
to the native search engine.

## Outcome

Implemented as `search_semantic` Tauri command. Embedder uses `ort` crate with
DirectML execution provider. 384-dimensional vectors stored in DuckDB.
Git commit: `69a9ae3`.
