## What

Final integrity check. Walk the entire graph and verify it's consistent, complete, and forward-flowing.

## How

1. Script or tool that reads all governance artifacts
2. Check: every artifact has relationships array with at least one entry
3. Check: bidirectional consistency across all relationship pairs
4. Check: null targets all have intended:true (no unresolved tensions left from migration)
5. Check: no deprecated fields remain anywhere
6. Report any issues found

## Verification

- Integrity check script runs clean with zero issues
- Pipeline flow report shows forward flow (observations → principles → practices → enforcement)
- Summary report committed as evidence
