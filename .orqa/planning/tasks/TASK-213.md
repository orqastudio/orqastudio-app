title: Extract project-specific requirements to graph-readable artifacts
description: Move project-specific sections from the orchestrator prompt to standalone artifacts discoverable via graph traversal — tech stack, naming conventions, verification gates.

epic: EPIC-053
depends-on: []
docs: []
skills:
  - orqa-governance
  - orqa-documentation
scope:
  - Move tech stack table to project.json or a project metadata artifact
  - Move naming conventions to coding-standards.md (may already exist there)
  - Move verification gates to a skill or process doc
  - Move role-to-subagent mapping to agent definitions or a skill
  - Ensure all moved content is discoverable via graph relationships
acceptance:
  - Project-specific content removed from orchestrator prompt
  - Content exists in appropriate artifacts
  - Graph edges make content discoverable (e.g., task.docs points to coding-standards.md)

## What

The orchestrator prompt's "Section 2: Project-Specific Requirements" is ~500 lines of content that should live in the artifact graph, not be inlined into every session.

## How

1. Identify all project-specific content blocks in orchestrator.md
2. For each block, determine the right destination artifact (project.json, coding-standards.md, skill, etc.)
3. Move content to destination, ensuring it's complete and self-contained
4. Update graph edges so the content is discoverable

## Verification

- Orchestrator prompt no longer contains project-specific tech stack details
- Content exists in appropriate artifacts with proper graph relationships
- Coding standards, naming conventions, and verification gates are all findable via graph
