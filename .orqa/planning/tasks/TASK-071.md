## What

The pre-commit hook already validates frontmatter against schema.json. Extend it to also validate body structure against the bodyTemplate definitions.

## How

After frontmatter validation passes, extract the markdown body (below closing `---`). For each required heading in bodyTemplate, check that `## Heading` exists in the body. Report missing required sections as errors.

## Verification

- Create a test artifact missing a required section — hook rejects it
- Create a valid artifact — hook passes
- Research artifacts with no template — hook skips body validation
