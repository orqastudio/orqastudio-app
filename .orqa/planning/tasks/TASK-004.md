  - No Claude-as-product-identity language (provider-agnostic framing)
  - Three-layer architecture (canon/project/plugin) referenced where governance discussed
  - Pillar names consistent (Clarity Through Structure, Learning Through Reflection)
  - Hardcoded artifact type lists note configurability via project.json

## What

Read each product doc listed in scope. For each one, check the 5 audit criteria
defined in the plan. Fix any misalignment in-place.

## Audit Criteria

1. `.claude/` references → `.orqa/` as source of truth
2. Claude-specific language → provider-agnostic
3. Three-layer (canon/project/plugin) distinction present where relevant
4. Pillar names consistent
5. Artifact types noted as configurable
