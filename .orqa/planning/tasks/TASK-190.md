## What

The governance UI surfaces enforcement violations so users can see what was
blocked, when, and by which rule. This completes the feedback loop from
enforcement to visibility.

## How

1. Create Tauri command to query violation history from SQLite
2. Create Svelte store for violation data
3. Create violations view component in the governance section
4. Add violation count badge to governance nav

## Verification

- Violations appear in the governance UI after enforcement blocks an action
- Filtering by rule/agent/time works
- Violation count in nav updates in real time
