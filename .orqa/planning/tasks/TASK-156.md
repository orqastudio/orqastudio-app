description: Change RULE-033's scope field from the undocumented value software-engineering to a valid value from the documented set.
status: done
created: "2026-03-11"
updated: "2026-03-11"
epic: EPIC-049
depends-on: []
scope:
  - Determine the correct scope value for RULE-033 (shadcn Tooltip usage) from the valid set
  - Valid values per artifact-framework: system, domain, project, role, artifact
  - Update the frontmatter
acceptance:
  - RULE-033 scope field uses a documented valid value
  - Value accurately reflects the rule's scope (likely project or domain)

## What

RULE-033 (Tooltip Usage) has `scope: software-engineering` which is not in the documented valid value set (`system | domain | project | role | artifact`). Fix to use the correct value.

## How

1. Read RULE-033 to understand its scope — it enforces shadcn Tooltip usage over native `title` attributes
2. Determine the correct scope: likely `project` (specific to this codebase's UI conventions) or `domain` (applies to any project using shadcn)
3. Update the frontmatter `scope` field

## Verification

- [ ] RULE-033 scope field uses a value from the valid set
- [ ] Value accurately reflects the rule's applicability
