## What

Document the plugin architecture including the path to SDK extraction for dynamic plugin views.

## How

1. Map current plugin capabilities (CLI companion plugin, MCP integration)
2. Identify components that should be extracted to a shared SDK
3. Design view registration API concept
4. Document theme token system for plugin authors
5. Reference [RES-046](RES-046) built-in vs plugin framework

## Verification

A plugin author could read this doc and understand what's available, what's planned, and how to prepare.
