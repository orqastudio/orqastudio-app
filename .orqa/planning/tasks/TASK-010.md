## What

The task YAML frontmatter should include:

```yaml
assignee: backend-engineer
skills:
  - chunkhound
  - orqa-ipc-patterns
```

This creates a traceable chain:
- **Plan** defines what needs doing
- **Task** specifies who does it and what knowledge they need
- **Agent** loads those skills before starting
- **Implementation** is done with the right context

Update:
1. `tasks/README.md` — add `skills` to the frontmatter schema
2. `artifact-framework.md` — add `skills` to the task type definition
