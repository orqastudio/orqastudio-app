## What

The plugin becomes the bridge between `.orqa/team/` and Claude Code, replacing
the symlink architecture. It reads agent definitions and skills directly and
exposes them to Claude Code's discovery system.

## How

1. Configure plugin to expose `.orqa/team/agents/` as the agents directory
2. Configure plugin to expose `.orqa/team/skills/` as the skills directory
3. In SubagentStart hook, resolve agent capabilities to CLI tools (TASK-175)
4. Verify Claude Code discovers agents and skills without symlinks

## Verification

- `/agents` shows agents from `.orqa/team/agents/`
- Skills are loadable via `/skill-name`
- Removing `.claude/agents/` and `.claude/skills/` symlinks doesn't break anything
