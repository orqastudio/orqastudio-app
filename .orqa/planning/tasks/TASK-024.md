## What

Extract business logic from the monolithic stream_commands.rs (2,425 lines) into
four focused domain modules.

## Outcome

Extracted to `tool_executor.rs` (~700 lines), `system_prompt.rs` (~150 lines),
`stream_loop.rs` (~350 lines), `session_title.rs` (~85 lines). Command file is
now thin orchestration only. Git commit: `7fd306e`.
