## What

Surface the artifact graph's cross-reference data directly in the viewer so users can see what references the current artifact and what it references, without leaving the viewer.

## How

1. Create `ReferencesPanel.svelte` in `ui/lib/components/artifact/`
2. Accept the current artifact ID as a prop
3. Call `referencesFrom(id)` and `referencesTo(id)` from the graph SDK
4. Render two collapsible sections: "Referenced by" (incoming) and "References" (outgoing)
5. Each reference rendered as an ArtifactLink chip
6. Place the component in ArtifactViewer below FrontmatterHeader

## Verification

- [ ] `make check-frontend` passes
- [ ] References panel appears below frontmatter header
- [ ] Clicking a reference chip navigates to the target artifact
- [ ] Sections with no references are hidden
