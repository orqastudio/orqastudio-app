scope:
  - .orqa/governance/rules/schema.json
  - .orqa/governance/rules/
acceptance:
  - Rule schema includes enforcement field (array of objects with event, pattern, action, message)
  - At least 5 key rules have enforcement entries added
  - All modified rules pass schema validation
  - Enforcement entries are mechanically testable patterns

## What

Extend the rule schema with the `enforcement` field defined in [EPIC-050](EPIC-050)'s design.
Then add enforcement entries to rules that have clear, pattern-matchable violations.

## How

1. Add `enforcement` to `.orqa/governance/rules/schema.json` as an optional array
2. Each entry: `{ event, pattern, paths (optional), action, message }`
3. Identify rules with mechanically enforceable patterns:
   - [RULE-006](RULE-006): `unwrap()` in production code → file event
   - [RULE-013](RULE-013): `--no-verify` on commits → bash event
   - [RULE-007](RULE-007): raw cargo/npm commands → bash event
   - [RULE-020](RULE-020): TODO/FIXME comments → file event
   - [RULE-025](RULE-025): files created in project root → file event
4. Add enforcement entries to those rules

## Verification

- Schema validates with ajv
- Rules with enforcement entries pass schema validation
- Each enforcement entry has a testable regex pattern
