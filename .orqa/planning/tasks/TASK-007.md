scope:
  - .orqa/project.json
  - src-tauri/src/domain/project_settings.rs
acceptance:
  - project.json has artifacts array with all current groups and types
  - ArtifactEntry enum (Group | Type) added to project_settings.rs
  - ArtifactTypeConfig struct with key, label, icon, path fields
  - artifacts field on project config struct with #[serde(default)]
  - Group variant listed before Type in untagged enum (serde ordering)
  - cargo build passes
  - cargo clippy -- -D warnings passes
description: >
  Define the artifacts config schema in project.json and add corresponding
  Rust types. This is the foundation — the scanner and frontend will read
  from this config.
tags: [config, rust, schema, artifacts]

## What

1. Add `artifacts` array to `.orqa/project.json` with all current groups/types
2. Add Rust types to `project_settings.rs`:
   - `ArtifactTypeConfig { key, label, icon: Option, path }`
   - `ArtifactEntry` untagged enum: `Group { key, label, icon, children }` | `Type(ArtifactTypeConfig)`
3. Add `artifacts: Vec<ArtifactEntry>` to the project config struct

## Config Values

See plan for the full artifacts array. Groups: docs, planning, team, governance.
Types within each group per current `.orqa/` directory structure.
