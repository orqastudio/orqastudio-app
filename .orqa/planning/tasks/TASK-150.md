title: Create task dependency validator hook
description: Pre-task hook that checks depends-on tasks have status done before allowing a task to start.
status: todo
created: "2026-03-11"
updated: "2026-03-11"
epic: EPIC-049
depends-on: []
scope:
  - Validate that all tasks in depends-on array have status done
  - Run before task status transitions to in-progress
  - Can be a hook script or an orchestrator-enforced check
acceptance:
  - Starting a task with unfinished dependencies produces a clear warning
  - Lists which dependencies are not done
  - Does not block if depends-on is empty or all dependencies are done

## What

RULE-004 defines the task dependency gate as NON-NEGOTIABLE — tasks with `depends-on` entries must have all dependencies at `status: done` before starting. Currently this is orchestrator-enforced via manual checking. Automate it.

## How

1. Create a validation script that reads a task's `depends-on` frontmatter
2. For each dependency, read the referenced task file and check its status
3. If any dependency is not `done`, report which ones and exit non-zero
4. Can be integrated as a pre-commit check (when task status changes to in-progress) or as a standalone validation script called by the orchestrator

## Verification

- [ ] Task with unfinished depends-on produces clear error listing blocked dependencies
- [ ] Task with all depends-on done passes validation
- [ ] Task with empty depends-on passes validation
- [ ] Script handles missing task files gracefully
