## What

Systematic audit of all governance rules to ensure enforcement accuracy and internal consistency.

## How

1. List all rule files in `.orqa/governance/rules/`
2. For each rule, verify cross-references, code patterns, and enforcement mechanisms
3. Check FORBIDDEN sections against actual codebase for accuracy
4. Fix stale content

## Verification

- `grep -r "RULE-" .orqa/governance/rules/` cross-references all resolve
- No rules reference non-existent files, commands, or patterns
