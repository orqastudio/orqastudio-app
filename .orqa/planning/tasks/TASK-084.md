## What

Systematic audit of all agent definition files to ensure internal consistency and accuracy against the current codebase and governance framework.

## How

1. List all `.md` files in `.orqa/team/agents/`
2. For each agent, read and verify skills, required reading, role description
3. Cross-reference with `.orqa/team/skills/` directory contents
4. Fix any broken references or stale content

## Verification

- `grep -r "plans\|Forge\|decisions\.md" .orqa/team/agents/` returns no results
- Every skill in every agent's `skills:` list has a matching directory in `.orqa/team/skills/`
- Every Required Reading path exists on disk
