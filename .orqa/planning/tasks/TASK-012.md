## What

Remove the Plan artifact type from artifact-framework.md. Add a Research schema. Update the traceability chain documentation to reflect Task → Epic → Milestone with research-refs for linking to investigation documents.

## Outcome

Completed by background agent. The Plan type was removed, Research schema added, and traceability chain updated. This task was part of the schema simplification sprint that was later continued directly by the orchestrator (no delegation) after the "don't refactor agentic structure while using agents" lesson was learned.
