title: "Artifact type definitions and classification"
description: >
  Adds formal one-paragraph definitions for each artifact type to the framework documentation
  and reclassifies any misclassified artifacts, flattening the research directory to a
  relationship-via-YAML-fields model.

scope:

  - .orqa/planning/research/
  - .orqa/planning/ideas/
  - .orqa/governance/rules/artifact-lifecycle.md
acceptance:
  - Each artifact type has a clear one-paragraph definition of its purpose and when to use it
  - Definitions include "use this, NOT that" guidance (e.g., "research is investigation, not implementation planning — use epics for that")
  - Misclassified research documents reclassified (e.g., UX polish sprint → linked to its epic)
  - Ideas with implemented features linked to decisions/epics via promoted-to field
  - Research directory flattened — no subfolders, relationships via YAML fields
  - artifact-framework.md updated with type definitions
  - artifact-lifecycle.md updated with classification rules

## Findings Addressed

- **F22**: Research documents misclassified (some should be epics)
- **F23**: Artifact type definitions unclear
- **F24**: Ideas not linked to implemented decisions/epics
- **F29**: Research subfolder organisation inconsistent — flatten and use YAML fields

## Notes

This is primarily a data + documentation task. The artifact framework needs formal type definitions that answer "when do I create this type?" for each artifact. Then existing artifacts need auditing against those definitions.
