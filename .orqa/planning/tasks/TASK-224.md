## What

Schema validation found 106 artifacts missing the required `description` field:

| Type | Count | Directory |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Ideas | 38 | `.orqa/planning/ideas/` |
| Decisions | 32 | `.orqa/governance/decisions/` |
| Tasks | 17 | `.orqa/planning/tasks/` |
| Lessons | 15 | `.orqa/governance/lessons/` |
| Epics | 4 | `.orqa/planning/epics/` |

These artifacts were created before `description` became a required schema field.

## How

1. For each artifact type, read the title and body to derive a one-line description
2. Add `description: "..."` to frontmatter in the correct property order position
3. Run the validation script to confirm 0 errors remain

A scripted approach may work for some (e.g., copying title as description), but most will need a human-readable summary derived from the body content.

## Verification

- Run `node /tmp/validate-artifacts.mjs` (or equivalent) — 0 errors across all 476+ artifacts
- Spot-check 5 artifacts per type to confirm descriptions are meaningful, not just title copies
