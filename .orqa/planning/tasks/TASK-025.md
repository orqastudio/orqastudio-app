## What

Apply the domain service extraction pattern (established in TASK-024) to the
remaining command files: setup, governance, and artifact commands.

## Outcome

All command files now follow the thin-command → domain service → repository
pattern. Git commits: `35b6f76`, `e55dd76`, `8750420`, `c60b181`, `e7d4d99`.

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
