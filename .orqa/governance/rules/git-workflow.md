**Source of Truth:** `@docs/development/agentic-workflow.md`

## Worktree Workflow (MANDATORY)

```bash
# 1. Create worktree at task start
git worktree add ../orqa-<task> -b <agent>/<task>
cd ../orqa-<task>

# 2. Work in isolation, commit regularly

# 3. Request code-reviewer approval BEFORE merging

# 4. Merge only after approval
cd ../orqa-studio && git merge <branch>

# 5. MANDATORY CLEANUP — no stale worktrees
git branch -d <branch> && git worktree remove ../orqa-<task>
```

## Worktree Cleanup (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Every completed task MUST have its worktree merged and cleaned up immediately.**

- **Kill all processes in the worktree BEFORE removal** — `ps -ef | grep "orqa-<task>"` then `kill` each PID. Background dev servers, test runs, and log tailers hold file locks that prevent directory deletion on Windows.
- Merge conflicts MUST be resolved aligned with the task goals:
  - Task changes take priority in task-modified files
  - Preserve unrelated changes from main in shared files
  - NEVER discard task work to resolve conflicts
  - NEVER discard unrelated main work
- After merge: kill processes -> delete branch -> remove worktree -> verify directory is gone
- No worktree should survive past its task completion
- Orchestrator verifies no stale worktrees accumulate after each task batch
- **If directory persists after removal**, there are still processes holding locks — find child processes too (e.g., `node.exe`, `cargo.exe` spawned by a killed bash shell)

## Background Process Discipline (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- **NEVER** launch perpetual commands (`npm run dev`, `cargo tauri dev`, `cargo watch`) as background tasks in worktrees
- **NEVER** leave background task processes running after a task completes
- Context compaction loses background task IDs, making orphaned processes unmanageable
- If a background task was launched, its ID must be tracked and the process stopped before worktree cleanup

## Untracked Files Policy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**Before starting ANY task, ALL untracked and modified files MUST be committed.** Untracked files are invisible to worktree operations and `git merge`. Starting work with uncommitted files risks silent data loss — the same class of problem as stashes.

**Session Start — Untracked File Check (MANDATORY):**

Run `git status --short`. If untracked (`??`) or modified (`M`) files exist: commit them to main with a descriptive message before creating any worktree or starting any task. The working tree must be completely clean before proceeding.

## Git Safety

**NEVER without verification:**

- `git checkout .`
- `git reset --hard`
- `git clean -fd`

**Before ANY revert:** `git status` then `git diff` to see what will be lost.

## Data Loss Prevention (CRITICAL)

**Before deleting or moving ANY directory:**

1. Verify replacement content exists and is committed: `git ls-tree HEAD -- <destination>`
2. Check for stashed work: `git stash list`
3. Never delete source-of-truth directories (docs/, src-tauri/, src/, tests/) without explicit user approval
4. Never `git rm -r` on directories with >5 files without user confirmation
5. If migrating content between directories, confirm destination is committed BEFORE deleting source

**Before bulk cleanup commits:** Run `git diff --cached --stat` and verify no documentation or source code is being accidentally deleted.

## Git Stash Policy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**`git stash` is ONLY for temporary use within a single procedure** (e.g., stash -> rebase -> pop). Must be popped/applied in the same command sequence. NEVER leave stashes at session end.

**Session Start:** Always run `git stash list`. If stashes exist, investigate (`git stash show -p`), commit the work, inform the user, then drop the stash.

**Why:** Stashes are invisible to worktree merges and cause silent data loss.

## FORBIDDEN

**NEVER use `--no-verify` on commits.** Fix the errors instead.

- `git commit --no-verify` — FORBIDDEN
- `git push --no-verify` — FORBIDDEN
- `git stash` as a way to park work between sessions — FORBIDDEN (commit to a branch instead)

If pre-commit hooks fail, it's YOUR responsibility to fix the issues.
