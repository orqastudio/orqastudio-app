## Candidate Items

- Problem mode — guided diagnosis flow with root cause mapping
- Idea mode — validation flow with feasibility exploration
- Goal mode — planning flow with gap analysis
- Chaos mode — triage flow with situation mapping
- Existing work assessment — AI scans folder structure, identifies contents (docs, code, config, READMEs), and proposes an .orqa/ hierarchy that reflects what already exists rather than imposing a template. Discovery-based, not requirements-based.
- Mode convergence — all paths produce same artifact structure
- Domain-agnostic templates — personal planning, healthcare, research, consulting
- Mode detection — AI suggests most appropriate entry mode
