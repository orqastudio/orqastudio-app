  - "FSL vs AGPL vs BSL — which fits best?"
  - Trademark registration process and cost
  - CLA requirements if accepting contributions

## Description

OrqaStudio currently ships with Apache 2.0 which offers zero protection against big tech absorption. [RES-045](RES-045) investigated options and recommends **FSL (Functional Source License) + Trademark**.

Key findings from research:
- **FSL**: Source-available, prohibits competing commercially, auto-converts to Apache 2.0 after 2 years. Backed by Sentry consortium. No "betrayal" narrative if set from the start.
- **AGPL v3 + Dual License**: True OSI open source but weaker against big tech (internal use allowed). More complex for a solo developer.
- **Trademark**: "OrqaStudio" should be trademarked regardless of code license choice.

## Decision Needed

This idea is shaped and ready for a decision ([AD-NNN](AD-NNN)). The user should choose:
1. FSL + Trademark (recommended)
2. AGPL v3 + Dual License + Trademark
3. Stay with Apache 2.0 (not recommended)

## Action Items After Decision

1. Replace LICENSE file with chosen license
2. Add `license` field to `Cargo.toml` and `package.json`
3. Register "OrqaStudio" trademark
4. If dual licensing: draft CLA before accepting contributions
