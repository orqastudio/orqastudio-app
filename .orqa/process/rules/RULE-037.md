title: Tool Access Restrictions

Tool access per role enforces ownership boundaries defined in [RULE-532100d9](RULE-532100d9). A Reviewer that can Edit would be tempted to fix issues instead of reporting them. A Researcher that can Write would be tempted to create artifacts instead of investigating.

## Role-to-Capability Matrix

Capabilities resolve to provider-specific tools via [RULE-92dba0cb](RULE-92dba0cb).

## Key Restrictions

- **Researcher and Planner** are read-only. They investigate and plan but do not modify files or run commands.
- **Reviewer** can run Bash (for checks like `make check`, `cargo test`) but cannot Edit or Write. It diagnoses but does not fix.
- **Writer and Designer** can Edit and Write but cannot run Bash. They produce artifacts and UI but do not run system commands.
- **Orchestrator and Implementer** have full access. The orchestrator is restricted by [RULE-532100d9](RULE-532100d9) to governance files only.

## FORBIDDEN

- Reviewer using Edit or Write to fix issues it found (send findings back to Implementer)
- Researcher using Edit or Write to create artifacts (report findings to orchestrator)
- Planner using Edit or Write to implement plans (plans are approved then delegated)
- Writer or Designer using Bash to run build/test commands (delegate verification to Reviewer)
