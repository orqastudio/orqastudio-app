Artifact IDs ([EPIC-045](EPIC-045), [TASK-051](TASK-051), [AD-029](AD-029), etc.) are sequential identifiers for uniqueness and reference. They carry NO information about priority, importance, or execution order.

## Rule

- **IDs are identifiers, not rankings.** [EPIC-001](EPIC-001) is not more important than [EPIC-045](EPIC-045).
- **Priority is explicit.** Use the `priority` field (P1/P2/P3) and scoring dimensions to determine importance.
- **Creation order is irrelevant.** When an artifact was created has no bearing on when it should be worked on.
- **Never sort by ID to imply priority.** Sort by priority field, then by dependency order.

## Why

Sequential IDs tempt agents into treating lower numbers as higher priority. This leads to working on old artifacts before newer, more urgent ones. Priority is a product decision expressed through the scoring framework, not an accident of creation order.
