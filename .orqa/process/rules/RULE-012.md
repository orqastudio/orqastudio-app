## Rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**ALL errors are YOUR responsibility. No exceptions.**

- Do NOT claim "this error existed before"
- Do NOT skip or ignore failures
- Do NOT commit with failing checks
- Pre-existing errors: Fix them as part of your commit
- Lint errors in files you did not write: Still your responsibility if they block the commit
- A broken linter config: Fix the config, don't skip the check

**"Not related to my changes" is NEVER an excuse.** If quality checks fail, you fix them — regardless of who introduced the failure. The codebase must be clean after every commit.

## Pre-Commit Hook Enforcement

A git pre-commit hook (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs quality checks based on which files are staged.

- **MUST NOT be bypassed** with `git commit --no-verify`
- If the hook fails, the commit is rejected — fix the errors and retry

## Integration Verification

**NEVER assume. ALWAYS verify.**

Before calling ANY existing function or API:

1. **Read the source** — Check actual function signature
2. **Check the types** — Verify parameter names and types
3. **Run checks** — Run the project's linter and type-checker to catch mismatches immediately

**NO backwards compatibility shims.** Fix ALL callers in the same commit.

## Code Search Integration

Use `search_regex` to find function definitions before calling them — faster and more thorough than manual file reading. Use `search_semantic` for "how does X work" questions.
