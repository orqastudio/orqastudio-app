title: Svelte keyed each blocks produce duplicate key errors from concatenated strings
description: "Keyed {#each} blocks that construct keys by concatenating data fields (e.g. artifact_id + message) crash when two items produce the same concatenation. This is a recurring frontend pattern — always include the index as a uniqueness suffix."

## Pattern

When rendering lists with `{#each items as item (key)}`, developers construct keys by concatenating data fields:

```svelte
{#each checks as check (check.artifact_id + check.category + check.message)}
```

This crashes with `each_key_duplicate` when two items share the same field values — common with integrity checks, validation findings, or any list where multiple entries can reference the same artifact with the same category.

Occurrences so far:
- `IntegrityWidget.svelte` — two broken link findings for the same rule produced identical keys
- This pattern appears in multiple list components across the frontend

## Fix

Always include the loop index as a uniqueness suffix:

```svelte
{#each checks as check, i (check.artifact_id + check.category + check.message + i)}
```

Or use a truly unique identifier (database ID, UUID) when available. The index suffix is the minimal fix when items don't carry unique IDs.
