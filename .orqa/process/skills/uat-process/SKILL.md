  Structured user acceptance testing methodology. Collect all findings first,
  group by systemic root cause, investigate architecture before proposing fixes,
  create tasks at the system level, and encode process improvements as lessons.
  Use when: Running UAT rounds, triaging user-reported issues, planning fix sprints.

Structured UAT methodology for the orchestrator and QA agents. Prevents premature fixing
and ensures systemic solutions.

## When to Load

- The user says "let's test", "UAT", "start testing", or similar
- An epic with UAT in its title moves to `in-progress`
- The user starts reporting issues in rapid succession
- Any batch of user-reported findings (3+)

## The Four Phases

### Phase 1: Collection

The user exercises the app. You listen and record.

**Your behaviour during collection:**
- Note each finding concisely — don't diagnose, don't propose fixes
- Respond with "Noted. Next?" or similar minimal acknowledgment
- Keep the user in flow — don't derail into discussion of individual issues
- If the user asks about a finding, give a brief answer but redirect to continued testing

**Recording format:**
```markdown
| # | Finding | Type | Area |
|---|---------|------|------|
| F1 | Description of what the user observed | bug/ux/data/missing | Area of the app |
```

Types:
- `bug` — broken, doesn't work
- `ux` — works but poor experience
- `data` — governance data quality issue (fixable without code)
- `missing` — not implemented

### Phase 2: Systemic Analysis

After the user says they're done testing:

1. **Group findings by root cause** — look for patterns:
   - Multiple findings about the same component → component design issue
   - Multiple findings about display of null/empty values → renderer issue
   - Multiple findings about inconsistent behaviour across types → missing shared abstraction

2. **Identify systemic themes** — name each theme and list which findings it covers:
   ```markdown
   ### Systemic Themes
   1. **Null value handling** — F4, F6, F7, F9 all stem from the renderer displaying every YAML field
   2. **Status UX** — F13, F14, F17 need a shared StatusIndicator component
   ```

3. **Investigate architecture** — delegate to Explore agents to understand:
   - Current component tree and data flow
   - Where the root cause lives in the code
   - What shared patterns exist or are missing
   - Memory/performance concerns

4. **Update the epic** with findings table and systemic themes

### Phase 3: Task Creation

Create tasks scoped to systemic solutions, not individual symptoms:

- One task per systemic theme (not per finding)
- Each task references the finding numbers it addresses
- Separate data quality fixes (no code needed) from code fixes
- Priority order: stability > functionality > UX > polish

### Phase 4: Fix, Verify, Encode

After implementation:

1. User re-tests specific areas
2. New findings → next UAT round (new epic)
3. **Process improvements MUST be encoded** (this is non-negotiable):
   - Create IMPL-NNN lessons for each process insight
   - Update relevant rules/skills/agents
   - Add `grounded-by` relationships on lessons that become enforcement artifacts

## The Learning Loop

UAT is not just testing — it is testing AND learning. Every UAT round must produce:

1. **Bug fixes** — the obvious output
2. **Process improvements** — the valuable output
3. **Governance updates** — lessons, rules, skills, agent updates
4. **Audit trail** — finding → lesson → enforcement artifact, fully traceable

A UAT round that only produces bug fixes has failed Pillar 2.

## Anti-Patterns

- Fixing issues one by one as they're reported (breaks systemic analysis)
- Creating a task per finding instead of per root cause
- Skipping the architectural investigation step
- Completing UAT without encoding process improvements
- Treating UAT as "just testing" rather than a learning opportunity
- Embedding UAT process only in the qa-tester agent (the orchestrator leads UAT)

## Orchestrator vs QA Tester Roles in UAT

| Phase | Who Leads | What They Do |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Collection | Orchestrator | Records findings from user, manages the session |
| Systemic Analysis | Orchestrator | Groups findings, identifies themes, delegates investigation |
| Task Creation | Orchestrator | Creates tasks scoped to systemic solutions |
| Technical Verification | QA Tester | Verifies fixes work end-to-end after implementation |
| Process Encoding | Orchestrator | Creates lessons, updates governance artifacts |
