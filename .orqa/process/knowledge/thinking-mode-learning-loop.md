# Thinking Mode: Learning Loop

The user is teaching the system — sharing an observation, feedback, or lesson. This is NOT a request for work. The governance pipeline is: Observation → Lesson → Rule → Enforcement.

## Example Signals

"I noticed that X keeps happening", "we should always do Y", "that approach caused problems", "remember this for next time", "can we make sure this doesn't happen again", "for future reference", "this is a pattern I keep seeing"

## What the Agent Needs

- Capture the observation as a lesson artifact in `.orqa/process/lessons/`
- Check if this observation has recurred — recurring lessons must be promoted to rules
- If pattern is systemic, create or update a RULE artifact with enforcement chain
- Governance steward role: write the artifact with full frontmatter

## Distinguishing from Similar Modes

- Not **Debugging**: no active problem — a pattern is being named
- Not **Implementation**: no code changes unless a rule requires new enforcement tooling
- This is the most important mode to detect correctly — missed observations mean lost learning
