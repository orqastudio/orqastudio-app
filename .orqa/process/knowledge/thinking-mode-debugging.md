# Thinking Mode: Debugging

Something is broken or behaving unexpectedly. The agent diagnoses — reproduce, isolate, identify root cause. Debugging ends when the cause is known; the fix routes to Implementation Mode.

## Example Signals

"this is broken", "why is X showing wrong numbers", "it's not working", "there's an error when I do Y", "the dashboard doesn't match", "something changed and now it fails", "the command returns unexpected results"

## What the Agent Needs

- Diagnostic methodology (`diagnostic-methodology` knowledge)
- Reproduction steps — can the failure be reliably triggered?
- Isolation strategy — narrow the failing layer (frontend/IPC/backend/data)
- Root cause classification: bug (→ Implementation) or governance gap (→ Learning Loop)

## Distinguishing from Similar Modes

- Not **Implementation**: root cause is unknown — diagnosis comes first
- Not **Research**: a specific failure exists — investigation is targeted, not exploratory
- Not **Review**: something is actively wrong, not just non-conformant
