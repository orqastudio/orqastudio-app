# Thinking Mode: Review

The user wants something checked, validated, or audited against standards. The agent produces a verdict (PASS/FAIL with evidence), not fixes. Reviewers never fix — they report.

## Example Signals

"review this code", "check if this meets standards", "validate the artifact graph", "audit the plugin manifests", "does this comply with the rules", "is this implementation complete", "check the four-layer completeness"

## What the Agent Needs

- Applicable rules loaded as context (RULE-006, RULE-010, etc.)
- Acceptance criteria from the task artifact
- The artifact graph relationships to check for structural integrity
- A structured verdict format: PASS/FAIL, evidence, specific violations

## Distinguishing from Similar Modes

- Not **Debugging**: no broken behaviour — standards compliance is the question
- Not **Implementation**: agent reports findings, never makes changes
- Not **Research**: the domain is known; the question is conformance
