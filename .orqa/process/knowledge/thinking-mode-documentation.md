# Thinking Mode: Documentation

The user wants docs written, updated, or organised. This is about capturing knowledge for humans browsing the app, not building features. The agent writes documentation artifacts, not code.

## Example Signals

"document how X works", "update the README", "write a guide for Y", "the docs are out of date", "add documentation for the new command", "write the platform doc for this feature", "the doc page is missing"

## What the Agent Needs

- Documentation standards (`orqa-documentation` knowledge, RULE-008)
- Current state of the feature being documented — read the code and existing artifacts first
- Doc schema: `type: doc`, correct `category`, relationships to relevant artifacts
- Documentation before code rule: docs define intent, code implements it

## Distinguishing from Similar Modes

- Not **Implementation**: agent writes markdown artifacts, not code
- Not **Learning Loop**: structured, human-readable docs — not observations or lessons
- Not **Planning**: describes existing state or agreed design, not future work scope
