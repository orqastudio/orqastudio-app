title: "Principles section — pillars, vision, and grounding documents as a dedicated nav section"
description: "Pillars are guiding principles that determine project purpose, not process artifacts. They should live alongside the product vision and agent grounding documents in a dedicated 'Principles' section. The current 'Process' section should be renamed to 'Learning' (rules, lessons, decisions, skills, agents) as it represents the learning and enforcement loop."

## Motivation

Pillars are currently under Process alongside rules, lessons, and decisions. But pillars aren't process artifacts — they're foundational principles that determine what the project IS, what ideas fit, and what work matters. They belong with the product vision and grounding documents, not with enforcement rules and implementation lessons.

The split:
- **Principles**: Pillars, vision, grounding docs (first-class artifact) — what the project believes and why
- **Learning** (renamed from Process): Rules, lessons, decisions, skills, agents — how the project improves
- **Discovery**: Ideas, research, wireframes (first-class artifact) — what the project is exploring

Wireframes belong in Discovery because that's when they're created — during exploration and shaping, before work is committed to the delivery pipeline. They're a discovery tool, not a reference document.

Grounding documents should be a first-class artifact type with their own schema, not just documentation files. They anchor agent behavior and project principles — that's structural, not prose.
