## Context

[EPIC-058](EPIC-058) gave every governance artifact a `relationships` array and pipeline stage fields. That was the **schema migration**. This epic is the **content migration** — ensuring every artifact's body text, organizational placement, and cross-references actually express the Knowledge Maturity Pipeline philosophy.

**The schema says "here are the edges." This epic says "are the edges meaningful, are the nodes in the right places, and does the whole structure tell a coherent story?"**

### The First-Class Artifact Principle

**If an artifact is needed by the learning loop, enforcement mechanism, or delivery cycle, it must be a first-class artifact** — schema-validated, relationship-tracked, integrity-enforced.

**Documentation is a human-readable guide maintained by AI.** It explains what things mean, how to use the app, and documents the product being built. It references process artifacts but never defines them. The process artifacts define themselves.

### Directory Reorganization

```
.orqa/
  process/              # The machine — pipeline artifacts
    pillars/            #   PILLAR-NNN — guiding principles
    lessons/            #   IMPL-NNN — observations & understanding
    decisions/          #   AD-NNN — architectural principles
    rules/              #   RULE-NNN — enforcement
    skills/             #   Skill directories — practice
    agents/             #   Agent definitions — roles

  delivery/             # The work — idea to verified outcome
    ideas/              #   IDEA-NNN
    research/           #   RES-NNN
    milestones/         #   MS-NNN
    epics/              #   EPIC-NNN
    tasks/              #   TASK-NNN
    verification/       #   VER-NNN — verification records (new)

  documentation/        # The human layer — guides, product docs
    guide/              #   What it all means, how to use the app
    product/            #   Vision, roadmap, product narrative
    architecture/       #   Contributor-facing architecture overview
    development/        #   Dev setup, commands, coding standards ref
```

Key changes from current structure:
- `governance/` dissolved — lessons, decisions, rules move to `process/`
- `governance/hooks/` removed — hooks are plugin implementation, not artifacts
- `team/` dissolved — skills, agents move to `process/`
- `planning/` renamed to `delivery/`, pillars move to `process/`
- `verification/` added under `delivery/` (new artifact type)
- `documentation/` stays but scoped to human-consumption content only

### App Layout Integration

After directory moves, `project.json` artifact config and all directory READMEs must be updated so the artifact scanner renders the new three-level structure correctly. Every directory needs README frontmatter (icon, label, description, sort) that the scanner extracts for nav tree rendering.

### Relationship & Metadata Display Research

A research document ([RES-049](RES-049)) investigates how artifacts should present their relationships and metadata to users in the app, given the revised structure and pipeline philosophy.

## Implementation Design

### Phase 0: Data Integrity (BLOCKING)

Broken links and missing inverses mean the graph is lying. Nothing else starts until this is clean.

1. Integrate integrity checks into pre-commit hook (staged-file mode)
2. Add `make verify` targets
3. Fix all broken links and frontmatter refs
4. Backfill missing bidirectional inverses
5. Codify as [RULE-045](RULE-045)

### Phase 1: Directory Reorganization

1. Create AD for directory reorganization ([AD-043](AD-043))
2. Move governance artifacts to `process/`
3. Move team artifacts to `process/`
4. Move pillars to `process/`, rename `planning/` to `delivery/`
5. Create verification artifact type (VER-NNN)
6. Scope `documentation/` to human-consumption content
7. Update `project.json`, README frontmatter, `.claude/` symlinks for app layout

### Phase 2: Content Alignment Audit

1. Rules content audit (44 rules)
2. Skills content audit (48 skills)
3. Agents content audit (7 agents)
4. Lessons maturity review (16 lessons)
5. Documentation inventory

### Phase 3: Pipeline Traceability

1. Create AD for standards distribution pattern ([AD-044](AD-044))
2. README alignment audit — every directory README describes pipeline role
3. Update all path references across codebase
4. Research: relationship and metadata display UX ([RES-049](RES-049))

## Out of Scope

- Populating VER-NNN verification artifacts (this epic creates the type)
- Building pipeline visualization in the app
- Plugin ecosystem implementation (TASK-307 covers the design only, not implementation)
- App UI changes for new directory structure (scanner handles it via config)
- Implementing any UX changes from [RES-049](RES-049) (that's a future epic)
- Implementing configurable paths runtime cache (TASK-306 investigates, implementation is a future epic if Option C is chosen)
