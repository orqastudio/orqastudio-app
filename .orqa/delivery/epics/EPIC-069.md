## Context

No notification strategy exists. Auto-fix confirmations are verbose and inline. Need to decide on toast messages, in-app notification panel, desktop notifications, and which events use which channel.

## Implementation Design

TBD — needs research on:
- Toast library (sonner? shadcn toast?)
- Desktop notification API (Tauri notification plugin)
- In-app notification panel design
- Event-to-channel mapping (what goes where)

## Tasks

- [TASK-444](TASK-444): Research notification strategy — toast, panel, desktop, event mapping
- [TASK-445](TASK-445): Implement toast notification system
- [TASK-446](TASK-446): Wire auto-fix and other confirmations to toast instead of inline

## Out of Scope

- In-app notification panel (future — needs more design)
- Desktop notifications (future — needs user preference controls)
