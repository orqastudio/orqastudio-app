## Why P1

The conversation IS the onboarding. Without this, new users don't know what to do.

## Tasks

- [ ] System prompt includes project state awareness (what artifacts exist, what's configured, what's missing)
- [ ] AI suggests next steps when project is new or incomplete ("I notice you don't have any rules defined yet...")
- [ ] First-conversation guidance — when no sessions exist, AI introduces OrqaStudio's capabilities naturally
- [ ] Entry mode detection — AI identifies which mode (Problem, Idea, Goal, Chaos) fits the user's opening message

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
