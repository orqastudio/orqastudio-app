## Why P1

UX design (Phase 0d) and technical design (Phase 0e) cannot proceed without knowing what the product is and who it serves.

## What Was Done

- Glossary — canonical terms used throughout the product and its governance
- Personas — target user archetypes with goals, contexts, and pain points
- User journeys — end-to-end flows for primary use cases
- Information architecture — structure of the app's navigation and content hierarchy
- MVP feature specification — the bounded set of capabilities that constitute the MVP

## Output

All product documentation in `.orqa/documentation/product/`.

## Notes

Retroactively captured. Work preceded the artifact framework.

## Context

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
