## Why P1

OrqaStudio is a structured thinking tool. Prioritisation is a core structured thinking capability. The dimensions and weights are configurable per project — different projects have different prioritisation needs.

## Tasks

- [ ] Priority dimensions — user configures dimensions and weights in `.orqa/project.json`
- [ ] Default dimensions: Impact (x2), Effort (x2, inverted), Urgency (x2), Pillar Alignment (x3)
- [ ] Composite priority score — weighted sum produces comparable number across all item types
- [ ] Priority bands — score ranges map to P1-P3 labels
- [ ] Auto-scoring — suggest dimension scores based on frontmatter when items are created
- [ ] Manual override with tracking
- [ ] Priority views — backlog sorted by composite score, filterable by band
- [ ] Custom dimensions — users add project-specific scoring dimensions

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
