## Context

The roadmap is currently a manually maintained markdown page. It should be an inferred dynamic view showing milestones as kanban columns with epic cards, drillable to task level.

## Tasks

- [TASK-456](TASK-456): Roadmap kanban view — milestone columns, epic cards, task drill-down
- [TASK-457](TASK-457): Register roadmap view under Process navigation (replace static doc)

## Out of Scope

- Drag-and-drop priority reordering (future — needs write-back to artifacts)
- Sprint/iteration planning (future)
