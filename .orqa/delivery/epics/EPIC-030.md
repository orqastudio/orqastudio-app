## Why P1

Nothing works without the scaffold. Every subsequent feature is built on top of this foundation.

## What Was Done

- Tauri v2 + Svelte 5 project initialised with configured plugins
- Rust backend: Agent SDK sidecar process with streaming via `Channel<T>`
- Rust backend: SQLite database with schema and migrations
- Rust backend: Session and message CRUD operations
- Rust backend: 40+ IPC commands across 8 domains
- Frontend: Four-zone layout (toolbar, sidebar, conversation, status bar)
- Frontend: Conversation UI with streaming token display
- Frontend: Tool call rendering with collapsible cards showing input and output
- Frontend: Session dropdown with history, search, and navigation
- Frontend: Settings view for provider configuration and model selection
- Semantic code search: ONNX embeddings server with DuckDB vector search
- End-to-end integration: send message, stream response, render in UI

## Notes

Retroactively captured. Work preceded the artifact framework. This is the baseline from which all milestone work proceeds.

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
