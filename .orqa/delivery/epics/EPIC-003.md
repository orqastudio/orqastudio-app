## Why P1

Can't restart the app during development without losing conversation context. Every Rust change requires a restart, so this directly blocks dogfooding workflow.

## Tasks

- [ ] Detect SDK resume failure in sidecar (returned session_id !== passed session_id)
- [ ] Sidecar emits `context_needed` event to Rust
- [ ] Rust loads last ~20 text messages from SQLite for the session
- [ ] Rust sends `context_history` to sidecar for injection
- [ ] Rust emits `ContextInjected` event for transparency [EPIC-001](EPIC-001)

## Context

This epic addresses a need identified during project development.

## Implementation Design

Implementation approach to be defined during planning.
