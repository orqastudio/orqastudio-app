## Implementation Design

### Fixes
1. **Streaming** — Proper NDJSON line buffering with partial message handling
2. **Output truncation** — Tool outputs beyond 500 chars collapsed with "Show more"
3. **Tool grouping** — Consecutive same-tool calls grouped into summary card
4. **Auto-naming** — After first assistant response, session auto-titled via LLM
5. **Custom titlebar** — Branded titlebar with window controls, project name, session indicator
6. **Error display** — Fix silent error swallowing in settings persistence

## Git Evidence

- `0aab794` — Fix error swallowing and settings persistence
