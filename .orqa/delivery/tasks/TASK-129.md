## What

Built the full conversation UI including role-based message bubbles, real-time streaming token display, and the multi-line message input area.

## How

Implemented `ConversationMessage` and related components that receive props from the conversation store. Streaming state is managed in the store and reactively reflected in the display via Svelte 5 runes.

## Verification

Messages render with correct role-based styling, streaming tokens appear live as they arrive, and the input area supports multi-line text with Enter-to-send.
