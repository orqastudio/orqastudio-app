title: Triage EPIC-059 observations (IMPL-018 through IMPL-025)
description: "Review all 8 observations logged during EPIC-059 implementation. For each: implement now if needed for epic completion, promote to rule/skill if at understanding maturity, or defer to a new IDEA if out of scope. No observation may remain untriaged when the epic closes."
status: completed
created: 2026-03-13
updated: 2026-03-13
acceptance:
  - Every IMPL-018 through IMPL-025 has a documented triage outcome
  - Implement-now items have tasks created within EPIC-059
  - Promote items have rule/skill/AD updates completed or tasks created
  - Defer items have IDEA-NNN entries created with relationship back to the observation
  - "No observation left at maturity: observation without a forward path"
relationships:
  - target: EPIC-059
    type: delivers
    rationale: Task belongs to this epic
  - target: TASK-308
    type: depends-on
  - target: TASK-349

## What

Triage each observation from [EPIC-059](EPIC-059) into one of three outcomes:

| Outcome | Action | When |
|---------|--------|------|
| **Implement now** | Create task in [EPIC-059](EPIC-059), do the work | Observation reveals a gap that blocks or undermines epic goals |
| **Promote** | Update to understanding, create rule/skill/AD | Observation is mature enough to become enforcement |
| **Defer to idea** | Create IDEA-NNN, add deferred-to relationship | Valid but out of scope for this epic |

## How

1. Read each [IMPL-018](IMPL-018) through [IMPL-025](IMPL-025)
2. For each, determine: does this need to be resolved for [EPIC-059](EPIC-059) to be honestly complete?
3. Apply the appropriate triage outcome
4. Present triage results to user for approval before executing

## Verification

- `grep -l "maturity: observation" .orqa/process/lessons/IMPL-{018..025}.md` returns zero results (all have moved forward)
- Each observation has either: a task, a promotion, or an IDEA with relationship edge
