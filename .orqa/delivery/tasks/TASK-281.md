## What

Add staged-file mode to the existing verification tools and wire them into the pre-commit hook.

## How

1. Modify `tools/verify-links.mjs` to accept `--staged` flag — reads `git diff --cached --name-only` and only checks those files
2. Modify `tools/verify-pipeline-integrity.mjs` to accept `--staged` flag — same approach
3. Add both to `.githooks/pre-commit` in the ORQA_CHANGED block alongside existing schema validation

## Verification

- Stage a file with a broken link, commit should fail
- Stage a file with a missing inverse, commit should fail
- Normal commits without .orqa/ changes pass without running these checks
