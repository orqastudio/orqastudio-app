acceptance:
  - Engine loads all .md files from .orqa/process/rules/
  - Engine parses YAML frontmatter including enforcement array
  - Engine filters by status (only active rules)
  - Engine filters by scope (agent ID matching)
  - Pattern matcher supports regex, glob, and contains matching
  - Engine is testable in isolation

## What

The rule engine is the core of the plugin. It reads rule files, parses their
frontmatter (including the `enforcement` array), and evaluates patterns against
tool call context.

## How

1. Implement rule loader: scan `.orqa/process/rules/*.md`, parse YAML frontmatter
2. Implement filters: status=active, layer matching, scope (agent ID) matching
3. Implement pattern matcher: regex patterns against event context fields
4. Implement enforcement evaluation: for each rule with enforcement entries, match
   event type + pattern against the current tool call context
5. Return action (block with message, warn with additionalContext, or allow)

## Verification

- Unit tests for rule loading, parsing, filtering
- Unit tests for pattern matching (regex, glob, contains)
- Integration test against OrqaStudio's actual rule files
