## What

Content audit of all 48 skills for correct classification and content alignment.

## How

1. List all skills with their current layer and category
2. For each: is the layer correct? (core vs project)
3. For each: does the name follow convention? (orqa-* for project-specific)
4. Identify overlaps between skills → resolve or document justification
5. Remove references to files/paths that no longer exist
6. Verify category (methodology/domain/tool) matches content

## Verification

- Skills audit report showing all changes made
- No layer misclassifications remain
- Naming convention consistently applied
