## Scope

Merge 4 pairs of overlapping documentation:

1. **DOC-038** (governance-hub.md, 99 lines) → **DOC-039** (governance.md, 239 lines): Both cover governance philosophy. Merge unique governance-hub content into governance.md, delete governance-hub.md.
2. **DOC-082** (guide/workflow.md, 105 lines) → **DOC-035** (process/workflow.md, 252 lines): Same topic in two directories. Merge any unique guide content, delete guide/workflow.md.
3. **DOC-048** (component-inventory.md, 213 lines) → **DOC-016** (svelte-components.md, 351 lines): Both catalog Svelte components. Merge, delete component-inventory.md.
4. **DOC-081** (artifact-types.md, 116 lines) → **DOC-036** (artifact-framework.md, 959 lines): Both explain artifact schemas. Merge, delete artifact-types.md.

For each merge: read both files, identify unique content in the source, integrate into the target, update all cross-references, delete the source file.
