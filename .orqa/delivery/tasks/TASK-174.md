## What

Update the two rules most affected by the tool abstraction:
- [RULE-001](RULE-001) (agent-delegation) — add capability resolution to the delegation protocol
- [RULE-026](RULE-026) (skill-enforcement) — update loading mechanism references

## How

1. In [RULE-001](RULE-001), add a step to the delegation protocol: "Resolve agent capabilities
   to current-context tool names using [RULE-040](RULE-040) mapping"
2. In [RULE-026](RULE-026), update references from "agent YAML tools list" to "agent capabilities
   resolved per context"
3. Add [RULE-040](RULE-040) to Related Rules in both

## Verification

- Both rules updated and pass schema validation
- Delegation protocol explicitly mentions capability resolution
- No references to concrete tool lists in agent YAML remain in either rule
