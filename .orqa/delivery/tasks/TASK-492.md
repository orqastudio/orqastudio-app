title: Roadmap all-done state and Done column collapse logic (F36)
description: "Implement the all-completed state for the roadmap kanban: when all items are in the Done column, show a celebration/completion state with a 'View board' button to reveal the full board. Fix Done column collapse logic so it only auto-collapses when non-done items exist."
