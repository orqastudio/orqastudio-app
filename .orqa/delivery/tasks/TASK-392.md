## What

Enable the app to fix deterministic integrity issues (missing bidirectional inverses) by writing the inverse relationship to the target artifact's YAML frontmatter.

## How

1. Define `AppliedFix` struct in `artifact_graph.rs`
2. Add `apply_fixes()` function that processes auto-fixable checks
3. For MissingInverse: parse target file YAML, add inverse relationship entry, write back
4. Add `apply_auto_fixes` Tauri command
5. Refresh the graph after applying fixes

## Verification

- `make check` passes
- Create a test with a one-directional relationship, run auto-fix, verify inverse was added
