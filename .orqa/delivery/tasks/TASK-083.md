assignee: AGENT-002
skills:
  - SKILL-030
  - SKILL-016
acceptance:
  - ArtifactLink uses artifactGraph.resolve(id) for navigation
  - ArtifactNav removes isTree guard — auto-select works for flat AND tree types
  - FrontmatterHeader uses SDK resolve to determine if a value is a valid artifact link
  - AppLayout watcher integration replaced with SDK auto-refresh
  - ARTIFACT_ID_RE regex in FrontmatterHeader removed — SDK determines linkability
