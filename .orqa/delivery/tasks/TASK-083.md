title: "Migrate nav and linking to SDK: ArtifactLink, ArtifactNav, FrontmatterHeader, AppLayout"
description: "Replace ArtifactLink prefix routing, ArtifactNav pendingArtifactId workaround, and AppLayout watch init with SDK-based patterns."
status: completed
created: 2026-03-10
updated: 2026-03-10
assignee: AGENT-002
acceptance:
  - ArtifactLink uses artifactGraph.resolve(id) for navigation
  - ArtifactNav removes isTree guard — auto-select works for flat AND tree types
  - FrontmatterHeader uses SDK resolve to determine if a value is a valid artifact link
  - AppLayout watcher integration replaced with SDK auto-refresh
  - ARTIFACT_ID_RE regex in FrontmatterHeader removed — SDK determines linkability
