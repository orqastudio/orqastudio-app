## What

Update the YAML `skills:` frontmatter on all 16 agent definitions to contain only
Tier 1 (portable) skills and the `code-search` wrapper. Remove all `orqa-*` project
skills and context-specific search skills.

## Scope

All agents in `.orqa/process/agents/`:
- orchestrator, backend-engineer, frontend-engineer, designer, debugger
- test-engineer, code-reviewer, data-engineer, devops-engineer
- documentation-writer, security-engineer, refactor-agent
- agent-maintainer, systems-architect, qa-tester, ux-reviewer

## Implementation Notes

For each agent:
1. Keep: `code-search`, `architecture`, language/framework skills relevant to their role
2. Remove: `chunkhound`, `orqa-native-search`, all `orqa-*` project skills
3. The `composability` meta-skill moves to Tier 2 (always injected by orchestrator)

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
