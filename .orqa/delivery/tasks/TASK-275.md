## What

Second backfill batch. Skills get a `category` field and `grounded` relationships. Methodology skills connect to pillars. Domain and tool skills connect to decisions.

## How

1. Run backfill tool against all skills
2. Tool proposes category classification and grounded connections
3. Review — category determines what the grounded target should be (PILLAR vs AD)
4. Approve, reject, or edit
5. Commit the batch

## Verification

- All 48 skills have `category` and `relationships` in frontmatter
- Methodology skills point to PILLAR-NNN, domain/tool skills point to AD-NNN
- Spot-check 5 skills for correct classification and connections
