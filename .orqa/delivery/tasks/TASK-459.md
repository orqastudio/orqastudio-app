## Scope

Priority assessment criteria live in `.orqa/documentation/product/priority-assessment.md` (DOC-062). Currently, epics have an optional `scoring` field with freeform rationale, but this isn't enforced or surfaced prominently.

- Display scoring/justification alongside priority in the metadata box
- If an epic/task has `priority` but no `scoring` or justification content, flag as action needed
- Add check to integrity validator: priority without justification is a warning
