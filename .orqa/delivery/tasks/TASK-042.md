## Findings Addressed

- **F16**: Loading spinner in main viewer too small — animation lost at current size

## Notes

Quick fix — change `<LoadingSpinner />` to `<LoadingSpinner size="lg" />` in ArtifactViewer.svelte (line 122). The "lg" variant (h-12 w-12) already exists and shows the branded logo-pulse animation at a visible size.
