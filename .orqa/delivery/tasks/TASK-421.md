acceptance:
  - sessionStore extracted and exported from SDK
  - projectStore extracted and exported from SDK
  - artifactStore extracted and exported from SDK
  - conversationStore extracted — DEFAULT_MODEL accepted as config, not imported from UI component
  - All stores import types from @orqastudio/types
  - All stores use SDK's invoke wrapper
  - Unit tests for each store's state transitions

## Scope

### From ui/src/lib/stores/
- `session.svelte.ts` → fully portable, no changes
- `project.svelte.ts` → fully portable, no changes
- `artifact.svelte.ts` → fully portable, depends on SDK graph
- `conversation.svelte.ts` → extract DEFAULT_MODEL to constructor/config parameter

### Modification needed
`conversationStore` imports `DEFAULT_MODEL` from `$lib/components/conversation/model-options`. This must become a config parameter so the store doesn't depend on a UI component.
