## What

Built the settings view for AI provider configuration and model selection, and integrated the ONNX embeddings engine with DuckDB for semantic code search.

## How

Implemented the settings UI with form fields backed by settings commands, and set up the native search engine in `backend/src-tauri/src/search/` using the `ort` crate for ONNX inference and DuckDB for vector storage.

## Verification

Provider config and model selection persist across restarts, and semantic code search returns relevant results via vector similarity.
