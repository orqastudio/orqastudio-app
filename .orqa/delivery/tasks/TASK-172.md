## What

Replace `tools` with `capabilities` in the agent schema. The rule (RULE-034) owns
the mapping from capabilities to provider-specific tools — agent definitions only
declare what they need, never concrete tool names.

## How

1. Read current agent schema
2. Remove `tools` property
3. Add `capabilities` property as an array of strings
4. Validate schema is well-formed

## Verification

- Schema file validates as JSON Schema
- Existing agent definitions still pass validation
- New `capabilities` field is accepted
