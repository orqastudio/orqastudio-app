id: TASK-044
title: Artifact type definitions and classification
description: "Adds formal one-paragraph definitions for each artifact type to the framework documentation and reclassifies any misclassified artifacts, flattening the research directory to a relationship-via-YAML-fields model."
status: completed
created: 2026-03-09
updated: 2026-03-09
assignee: AGENT-003
acceptance:
  - Each artifact type has a clear one-paragraph definition of its purpose and when to use it
  - "Definitions include 'use this, NOT that' guidance"
  - Misclassified research documents reclassified
  - Ideas with implemented features linked to decisions/epics via promoted-to field
  - "Research directory flattened — no subfolders, relationships via YAML fields"
  - artifact-framework.md updated with type definitions
  - artifact-lifecycle.md updated with classification rules
relationships:
  - target: EPIC-043
    type: delivers
    rationale: Task belongs to this epic
  - target: SKILL-011

## Findings Addressed

- **F22**: Research documents misclassified (some should be epics)
- **F23**: Artifact type definitions unclear
- **F24**: Ideas not linked to implemented decisions/epics
- **F29**: Research subfolder organisation inconsistent — flatten and use YAML fields

## Notes

This is primarily a data + documentation task. The artifact framework needs formal type definitions that answer "when do I create this type?" for each artifact. Then existing artifacts need auditing against those definitions.

## What

See task description and acceptance criteria in frontmatter.

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
