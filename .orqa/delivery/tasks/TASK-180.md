acceptance:
  - "PreToolUse hook fires before Edit, Write, and Bash tool calls"
  - Hook loads active rules with enforcement entries
  - File events match against file_path and new_text fields
  - Bash events match against command field
  - Violations return block with message or warn with additionalContext
  - Non-violations allow the tool call to proceed

## What

The PreToolUse hook is the primary enforcement mechanism. It intercepts tool calls
before execution and evaluates them against active rules that have `enforcement`
entries in their frontmatter.

## How

1. Create `hooks/pre-tool-use.md` hook definition
2. On each tool call, build enforcement context from tool name and input
3. Load active rules with enforcement entries (via rule engine from TASK-178)
4. For each rule: match event type (file/bash) and evaluate pattern
5. If match: return block or warn action per the enforcement entry
6. If no match: return continue (allow)

## Verification

- Test: Edit with `unwrap()` in Rust file → blocked by [RULE-006](RULE-006)
- Test: Bash with `--no-verify` → blocked by [RULE-013](RULE-013)
- Test: Normal Edit → allowed through
- Test: Rule with status=inactive → not enforced
