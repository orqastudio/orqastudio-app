## What

The plugin README should clearly explain what the OrqaStudio Claude Code companion
plugin provides and how to install it.

## How

1. Update `.orqa/plugins/orqastudio-claude-plugin/README.md`
2. Document: what hooks are provided, what skills are included, installation steps
3. Keep it concise — reference governance docs for detailed rule/skill documentation

## Verification

- README exists with installation section
- All plugin components (hooks, skills) are listed
