## What

Established the Decision artifact type as a first-class citizen in the governance framework.

## How

Updated artifact-framework.md with Decision schema, artifact-workflow.md with creation workflow, [RULE-004](RULE-004) with lifecycle enforcement, and [RULE-002](RULE-002) with source-of-truth directive.

## Verification

Decision type is defined, enforceable, and discoverable through the artifact framework.
