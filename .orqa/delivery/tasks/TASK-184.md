## What

Slash commands give the user direct governance interaction from within Claude Code.

## How

1. Create `commands/orqa.md` — main governance summary
2. Create `commands/orqa-rules.md` — list active rules with enforcement status
3. Create `commands/orqa-status.md` — governance health check
4. Each command reads from `.orqa/` and presents structured output

## Verification

- `/orqa` returns governance summary
- `/orqa:rules` lists rules with enforcement status markers
- `/orqa:status` reports health metrics
