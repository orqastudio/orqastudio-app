  lesson documentation.

depends-on:
  - TASK-195
acceptance:
  - evidence-before-done gate fires at Stop when code was written but no make check/test ran
  - learn-after-doing gate fires at Stop when significant work done but no lessons checked
  - Gates return systemMessage reminders

## What

Two process gates:
- **evidence-before-done**: Fires at Stop event when the session included code
  writes but no `make check`/`make test` was run. Injects review prompt.
- **learn-after-doing**: Fires at Stop event when the session included significant
  work but no lessons were checked or created. Injects learning prompt.

## How

1. Add gate logic to Stop hook evaluation
2. Query WorkflowTracker for verification commands and lesson interactions
3. Return `systemMessage` with review/learning prompts

## Verification

- End session with code writes but no `make check` → reminder fires
- End session with code writes and `make check` run → no reminder
- End session with significant work but no lesson check → reminder fires
