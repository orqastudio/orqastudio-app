## What

Create [RULE-045](RULE-045) codifying the data integrity requirements established in Phase 0.

## How

1. Create `.orqa/process/rules/[RULE-045](RULE-045).md` with frontmatter and body
2. Cover all integrity requirements: link resolution, bidirectional inverses, enforcement mechanisms
3. Reference related rules (RULE-032, [RULE-034](RULE-034), RULE-013)

## Verification

- [RULE-045](RULE-045) exists and passes schema validation
- Rule content accurately reflects the enforcement implemented in [TASK-281](TASK-281)/282
