## What

Verify all governance hooks are functional and reference correct paths.

## How

1. List all files in `.orqa/process/hooks/`
2. Read each hook script
3. Verify file paths and commands referenced
4. Run hooks in test mode if possible

## Verification

- Each hook script runs without path-related errors
- No hooks reference deprecated paths or commands
