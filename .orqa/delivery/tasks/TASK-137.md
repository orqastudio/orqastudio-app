## What

Built the governance coverage dashboard widget displaying per-area coverage percentages, an overall health score, and a link to the detailed analysis view.

## How

Implemented the widget as a composable component reading from the governance store, using progress bars and badges to visualize coverage per area. The overall score is derived from the area scores and links navigate to the analysis view.

## Verification

Widget renders coverage visually, percentages reflect actual scan results, and the link navigates correctly to the detailed analysis view.
