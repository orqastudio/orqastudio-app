assignee: AGENT-006
acceptance:
  - System prompt sent (N chars) appears inline above assistant response when project is loaded
  - Clicking the entry opens ContextDetailDialog with governance prompt text visible
  - ThinkingBlock renders during streaming if thinking deltas arrive
  - No context entry appears when no project is loaded
  - Conversation streaming works normally in all cases (no regression)

## What

After [TASK-001](TASK-001) is implemented, verify the full pipeline works: Rust emission → Channel<T> → store accumulation → component rendering.

## Test Cases

1. **With project loaded:** Send a message → verify "System prompt sent (N chars)" appears inline
2. **Inspect dialog:** Click the context entry → verify dialog opens with Structured/Raw tabs
3. **Structured tab:** Shows "Governance Prompt" section with char count and content
4. **Raw tab:** Shows full prompt text in code block
5. **Without project:** Send a message → no context entry → no error
6. **ThinkingBlock:** If thinking deltas arrive, verify amber block appears and auto-collapses
7. **No regression:** Tool calls, streaming text, cancel all still work

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
