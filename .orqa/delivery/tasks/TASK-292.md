## What

Ensure the app's artifact scanner picks up the new directory structure correctly by updating all configuration and metadata files.

## How

1. Rewrite `project.json` artifacts array for three-level structure
2. Audit and update every README.md in artifact directories for correct frontmatter
3. Recreate `.claude/` symlinks pointing to new paths
4. Verify CLAUDE.md symlink still resolves

## Verification

- `project.json` paths all resolve to existing directories
- Every artifact directory has a README with valid frontmatter
- `.claude/` symlinks are not broken
- App renders new structure in sidebar navigation
