title: Cross-layer consistency verification
description: "Verify consistency across the orchestrator, agents, skills, and rules layers — skill injection tables, agent-to-subagent mappings, orphaned artifacts, and cross-references."

acceptance:
  - Orchestrator skill injection table lists only skills that exist
  - Agent-to-subagent mapping matches available Claude Code subagent types
  - No orphaned skills or rules without justification
  - Orchestrator instructions are consistent with active rule content

## What

Final cross-layer verification ensuring all team and enforcement artifacts are internally consistent with each other and with the orchestrator definition.

## How

1. Read orchestrator agent definition (source of CLAUDE.md)
2. Cross-reference skill injection table with `.orqa/process/skills/` contents
3. Cross-reference agent-to-subagent mapping with available subagent types
4. Search for skills and rules not referenced by any other artifact
5. Verify orchestrator instructions don't contradict active rules

## Verification

- Every skill in the injection table exists in `.orqa/process/skills/`
- Every subagent type in the mapping is available in Claude Code
- Orphan report is clean or justified
