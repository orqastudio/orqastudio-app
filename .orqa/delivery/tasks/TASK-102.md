## What

Created the architecture decisions index at `.orqa/documentation/architecture/decisions.md`, listing all AD records with their status, category, and brief summaries.

## How

Compiled entries for all existing AD artifacts, organized them by category, and added cross-reference links between related decisions.

## Verification

The decisions index exists and lists all AD artifacts; it is registered in the project config for scanner discovery.
