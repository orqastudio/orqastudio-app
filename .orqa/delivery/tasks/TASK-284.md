## What

Ensure bidirectional consistency across all relationship edges in the artifact graph.

## How

1. Run `node tools/verify-pipeline-integrity.mjs` to identify missing inverses
2. For each missing inverse, add the corresponding relationship to the target artifact
3. If target artifact type lacks a relationships field (e.g., pillars), update schema to support optional relationships
4. Commit in batches

## Verification

- `node tools/verify-pipeline-integrity.mjs` reports zero missing inverses
- `make verify-integrity` passes clean
