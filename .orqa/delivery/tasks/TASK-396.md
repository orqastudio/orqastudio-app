title: Audit components for invoke()-to-SDK migration opportunities
description: "Audit all Svelte components in ui/src/lib/components/ for direct invoke() calls that could be replaced with artifactGraphSDK lookups. Finding: no migration needed — only invoke() in components is artifact_watch_start (a watcher command, not a graph query)."

## What

Audit whether any Svelte components bypass the SDK and call `invoke()` directly for data the artifact graph already provides.

## Finding

Only one `invoke()` call exists in `ui/src/lib/components/`: `artifact_watch_start` in `AppLayout.svelte`. This is a file-system watcher operation — not a graph query — so it correctly uses `invoke()` rather than the SDK.

All graph data access in components already goes through `artifactGraphSDK`. No migration needed.
