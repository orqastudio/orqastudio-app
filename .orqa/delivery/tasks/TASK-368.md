## What

Automate the learning loop's recurrence tracking and promotion readiness detection.

## How

Extend verify-pipeline-integrity.mjs or create new tooling to scan review agent output for failure patterns matching existing lessons, auto-increment recurrence, and surface promotion-ready lessons.

## Verification

Completed as part of [EPIC-061](EPIC-061) Phase 3.

## Lessons

No new lessons.
