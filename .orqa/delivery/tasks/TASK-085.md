## What

Systematic audit of all skill definition files to ensure the patterns, examples, and references they contain are accurate against the current codebase.

## How

1. List all skill directories in `.orqa/process/skills/`
2. For each skill, read SKILL.md and any supporting files
3. For code patterns: search codebase to verify they match reality
4. For file paths: verify they exist on disk
5. Fix any stale content

## Verification

- Every file path referenced in skill examples exists
- Code patterns in skills match `grep`/`search_regex` results from the actual codebase
- No skills reference removed or renamed modules
