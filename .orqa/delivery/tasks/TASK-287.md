## What

Move governance artifacts (lessons, decisions, rules) from `.orqa/process/` to `.orqa/process/`. Remove `governance/hooks/` since hooks are plugin implementation.

## How

1. `git mv .orqa/process/lessons/ .orqa/process/lessons/`
2. `git mv .orqa/process/decisions/ .orqa/process/decisions/`
3. `git mv .orqa/process/rules/ .orqa/process/rules/`
4. Remove `.orqa/process/hooks/` (verify hooks are in plugin, not here)
5. Update `project.json` artifact paths
6. Update `.claude/` symlinks
7. Update `.githooks/pre-commit` paths
8. Search and update all references in rules, skills, agents, docs

## Verification

- All files accessible at new paths
- `project.json` paths resolve correctly
- Pre-commit hook runs successfully
- No references to old `.orqa/process/` paths remain
