## What

Completed the full IPC command surface across settings, governance, file tools, and system info domains.

## How

Implemented `#[tauri::command]` handlers in domain-specific command modules (`settings_commands.rs`, `governance_commands.rs`, `tool_commands.rs`) and registered all commands in `lib.rs`.

## Verification

All commands are callable from the frontend, return typed results, and surface errors via `OrqaError`.
