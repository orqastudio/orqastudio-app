## What

Move pillars to `process/` (they're pipeline artifacts, not delivery items). Rename `planning/` to `delivery/` to reflect its actual purpose.

## How

1. `git mv .orqa/process/pillars/ .orqa/process/pillars/`
2. `git mv .orqa/delivery/ .orqa/delivery/`
3. Update `project.json` artifact paths
4. Search and update all references

## Verification

- All files accessible at new paths
- `project.json` paths resolve correctly
- No references to old `.orqa/delivery/` paths remain
