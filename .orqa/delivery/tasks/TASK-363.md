## What

Create ESLint rules to mechanically enforce five previously self-compliance-only rules.

## How

Add custom ESLint rules or configure existing ones for each pattern: no invoke() in $lib/components/, no title= on interactive elements, no inline empty/loading/error patterns, no duplicate keys in unions/maps, and root directory content restrictions.

## Verification

Completed as part of [EPIC-061](EPIC-061) Phase 2.

## Lessons

No new lessons.
