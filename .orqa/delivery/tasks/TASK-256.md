## What

Move the dev controller and dashboard to their own directory.

## How

1. `mkdir debugger && git mv scripts/dev.mjs debugger/ && git mv scripts/dev-dashboard.html debugger/`
2. Update Makefile: all `node scripts/dev.mjs` → `node debugger/dev.mjs`
3. Update `debugger/dev.mjs`: DASHBOARD_HTML path
4. Remove `scripts/` if empty
5. Verify with `make dev && make kill`

## Verification

- [ ] `make dev` starts controller, Vite, and Tauri
- [ ] Dashboard accessible at localhost:3001
- [ ] `make kill` stops everything cleanly
