  - All 42 decisions have a relationships array
  - Each decision has practices and enforces relationships (nullable with rationale)
  - Connections reference skills and rules already backfilled in TASK-274/TASK-275
  - Bidirectional consistency — if AD-029 says practices:SKILL-X, SKILL-X says grounded:AD-029
  - Human reviewed and approved all proposals

## What

Third backfill batch. Decisions are the Principle stage — they connect downstream to skills (Practice) and rules (Enforcement). Since rules and skills are already backfilled, the tool can cross-reference for bidirectional consistency.

## How

1. Run backfill tool against all decisions
2. Tool proposes practices (skills) and enforces (rules) connections, cross-referencing already-backfilled artifacts
3. Verify bidirectional consistency — if a decision points to a skill, that skill should already point back
4. Approve, reject, or edit
5. Commit the batch

## Verification

- All 42 decisions have `relationships` in frontmatter
- Bidirectional consistency check passes (sample 5 decisions, verify both directions)
- Null targets have rationale and intended field
