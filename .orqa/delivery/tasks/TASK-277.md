## What

Final backfill batch. Lessons are the smallest set (16). Each gets a `maturity` classification and relationships. Understanding-stage lessons must connect to a principle (decision).

## How

1. Run backfill tool against all lessons
2. Tool proposes maturity classification based on content (does it identify root cause = understanding, or just describe what happened = observation?)
3. For understanding-stage lessons, propose grounded connections to decisions
4. Approve, reject, or edit
5. Commit the batch

## Verification

- All 16 lessons have `maturity` and `relationships` in frontmatter
- No understanding-stage lesson lacks a grounded relationship
- Spot-check all 16 (small enough set to verify completely)
