## What

Built the four-zone desktop layout (toolbar, sidebar, main content, status bar) with resizable panels and sidebar navigation.

## How

Implemented the layout using Tailwind CSS flex/grid utilities, drag-handle components for panel resizing, and sidebar navigation with session list and artifact section links.

## Verification

The four-zone layout renders at all supported sizes, sidebar navigation works, and panel resizing operates smoothly via drag handles.
