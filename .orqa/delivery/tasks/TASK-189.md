## What

Connect the enforcement engine to the app's tool approval pipeline so rules are
evaluated before every tool execution during agent conversations.

## How

1. In the tool approval flow, call the enforcement engine with tool name and input
2. If blocked: return denial with enforcement message
3. If warned: pass through with additionalContext containing the warning
4. If allowed: proceed normally
5. Log all enforcement decisions to SQLite (violation audit trail)

## Verification

- Blocked tool attempts are denied with the rule's enforcement message
- Warnings appear in the conversation context
- Violations are persisted to SQLite
