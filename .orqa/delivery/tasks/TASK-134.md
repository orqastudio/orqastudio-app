## What

Built the coverage analysis engine that evaluates scan results against defined governance areas and identifies gaps.

## How

Defined coverage areas as an enum with expected artifact counts per area, then implemented a scoring pass over the scan results to compute coverage percentages and enumerate missing artifact types.

## Verification

Coverage analysis correctly identifies covered and uncovered governance areas, reports specific gaps, and produces structured results consumable by the frontend.
