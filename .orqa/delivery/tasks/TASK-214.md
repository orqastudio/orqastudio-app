## What

The companion plugin becomes the primary consumer of graph edges. When an agent starts working on a task, the plugin reads the task's `docs` and `skills` fields and automatically injects that context — no hardcoded injection table needed.

## How

1. On SessionStart, check session state for current task ID
2. Read the task's frontmatter from `.orqa/delivery/tasks/TASK-NNN.md`
3. For each entry in `docs`: read the file and inject as `systemMessage`
4. For each entry in `skills`: load the skill via the plugin's skill mechanism
5. Follow `task.epic` → read epic for design context
6. Track what's been injected to prevent duplicates

## Verification

- Plugin reads task frontmatter docs and skills arrays
- Referenced docs are injected as system context
- Referenced skills are loaded into agent context
- No duplicate injection in the same session
