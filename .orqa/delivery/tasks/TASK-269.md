## What

The orchestrator exception list says `.orqa/delivery/` is orchestrator territory, but writing research findings is content creation (Writer role). Tighten the boundary.

## How

1. Update [RULE-001](RULE-001) exception list to clarify:
   - Creating task/epic/idea structure = orchestrator
   - Writing research content, documentation pages = delegate to Writer
2. Keep it concise — add one clarifying sentence, not a new rule

## Verification

[RULE-001](RULE-001) clearly distinguishes structure creation from content authoring.
