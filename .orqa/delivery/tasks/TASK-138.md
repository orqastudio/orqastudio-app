## What

Connected the full governance pipeline end-to-end: scan trigger → analysis → recommendations → dashboard widget update.

## How

Created the governance Svelte store managing scan state, analysis results, and recommendations. Wired all frontend components to the store via `invoke()` calls, and verified the full pipeline produces real data from scan trigger through to dashboard display.

## Verification

Triggering a scan produces analysis and recommendations, the dashboard widget reflects fresh data after each scan, and all IPC commands return real data.
