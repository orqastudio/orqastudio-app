assignee: AGENT-002
acceptance:
  - ArtifactViewer reads metadata from artifactGraph.resolve() or resolveByPath()
  - AgentViewer and SkillViewer read metadata from graph instead of parsing frontmatter
  - Internal link click handler uses SDK-based navigation
  - parseFrontmatter() kept as fallback for files not yet in graph
