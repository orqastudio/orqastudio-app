Recorded four foundational architecture decisions covering the sidecar integration pattern, streaming pipeline design, security model, and MCP host approach.

## How

Authored each AD artifact with context, decision rationale, consequences, and status, then added each entry to the decisions index.

## Verification

[AD-007](AD-007) through [AD-010](AD-010) exist in `.orqa/process/decisions/` with all required schema fields and are listed in the decisions index.
