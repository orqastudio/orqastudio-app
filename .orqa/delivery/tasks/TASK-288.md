## What

Move team artifacts (skills, agents) from `.orqa/process/` to `.orqa/process/`.

## How

1. `git mv .orqa/process/skills/ .orqa/process/skills/`
2. `git mv .orqa/process/agents/ .orqa/process/agents/`
3. Update `project.json` artifact paths
4. Update `.claude/` symlinks
5. Search and update all references in rules, skills, agents, docs

## Verification

- All files accessible at new paths
- `project.json` paths resolve correctly
- `.claude/` symlinks work
- No references to old `.orqa/process/` paths remain
