![OrqaStudio™](../ui/lib/assets/banner.png)

Desktop app for managed agentic development. Claude Code's capabilities with a visual process layer.

## What OrqaStudio Does

- **Wraps Claude Code** — Same model, same capabilities, but with a UI that surfaces the process layer
- **Backfills governance** — Point it at an existing codebase, answer questions, and OrqaStudio progressively builds the documentation, rules, and agent definitions through conversation
- **Makes process visible** — Scanner dashboards, task pipelines, retrospective cards, and metrics charts replace terminal output
- **Persists everything** — Conversation history linked to artifacts, searchable across sessions

## Product Pillars

**Pillar 1: Clarity Through Structure** — Making governance visible and manageable. Standards, rules, and workflows are not invisible infrastructure — they are tangible, enforceable, and browsable.

**Pillar 2: Learning Through Reflection** — The system and its users improve over time. Retrospectives, metrics, and lessons feed back into governance. Every session makes OrqaStudio smarter.
