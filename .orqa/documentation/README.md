![OrqaStudio™](../ui/lib/assets/banner.png)

Desktop app for managed agentic development. Claude Code's capabilities with a visual process layer.

## What OrqaStudio Does

- **Wraps Claude Code** — Same model, same capabilities, but with a UI that surfaces the process layer
- **Backfills governance** — Point it at an existing codebase, answer questions, and OrqaStudio progressively builds the documentation, rules, and agent definitions through conversation
- **Makes process visible** — Scanner dashboards, task pipelines, retrospective cards, and metrics charts replace terminal output
- **Persists everything** — Conversation history linked to artifacts, searchable across sessions

## Product Pillars

Active pillars are defined in `.orqa/planning/pillars/`. Every feature must serve at least one active pillar. See the **Pillars** section under Planning for the current pillar definitions and their test questions.
