# Tech Debt Management Guide

## What is tech debt in OrqaStudio?

Tech debt is the gap between what the code does and what the schemas define. OrqaStudio is schema-driven — `core.json` and plugin manifests are the source of truth for artifact types, relationships, and validation rules. Any code that hardcodes these values instead of reading them from the schema is debt.

## The Zero-Debt Principle

The project maintains zero tech debt as a baseline. This means:

1. **Every architectural change is followed through completely** — no partial migrations
2. **Schema changes propagate to all code in the same commit** — not "we'll fix that later"
3. **Automated detection catches drift immediately** — before it compounds
4. **Debt found is debt fixed** — it doesn't go on a backlog to age

## Common Sources of Debt

### 1. Schema Changes Without Code Follow-Through

When you add a new relationship to `core.json`, every file that references relationship keys must be checked. The schema changed but the code didn't follow.

**Prevention:** Before changing core.json, grep the entire codebase for affected values. Change everything in one commit.

### 2. Duplicate Implementations

Two files implementing the same logic. When one gets updated, the other drifts.

**Prevention:** Extract shared logic to a common module. Use `include_str!` for config files instead of copies. The Rust backend should have ONE `active_project_path()`, not six.

### 3. Hardcoded Values

String literals in code that should come from the schema. When the schema changes, the code doesn't know.

**Prevention:** Always read from the registry, schema, or config. Never write a relationship key as a string literal in application code.

### 4. In-App Manifests Out of Sync

The in-app plugin registration (`manifest.ts`) diverging from the canonical plugin manifest (`orqa-plugin.json`). Two sources of truth for the same thing.

**Prevention:** The in-app manifest should import or mirror the canonical manifest exactly. Ideally, generate one from the other.

### 5. Dead Dependencies

Packages listed in `package.json` or `Cargo.toml` that are never imported. They bloat builds and create false assumptions about what's used.

**Prevention:** Remove dependencies when you stop using them. Check with `npm ls` or `cargo tree`.

## Detection

### Automated

Run these regularly (ideally as CI checks):

```bash
# Schema compliance — do all artifacts match the schema?
orqa validate

# Rust compilation — does the backend compile cleanly?
cargo check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# TypeScript compliance — do all libs typecheck?
make verify-types && make verify-sdk && make verify-cli

# Frontend compliance — does the app typecheck?
make verify-app

# Full test suite
cargo test
```

### Manual Audit

Run after any architectural change:

1. Grep for old values that should have been renamed
2. Diff in-app manifests against plugin manifests
3. Check for duplicate helper functions
4. Verify all paths reference current directory structure
5. Check all dependencies are actually imported

## Resolution

1. Fix in isolation — one category per commit
2. Don't mix debt fixes with feature work
3. Verify with the full test suite before committing
4. Update skills and documentation if the fix changes behaviour

## This is a Governance Concern

Tech debt undermines the "schema IS the rule" principle. If code hardcodes values that the schema defines, then changing the schema doesn't change the behaviour — it just creates a lie. The schema says one thing, the code does another.

This is why tech debt is treated as a blocking issue, not a backlog item. It's not cosmetic — it's a governance failure.
