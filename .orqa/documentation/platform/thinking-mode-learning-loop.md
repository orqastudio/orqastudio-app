## What This Mode Is

Learning Loop Mode is active when the user is teaching the system — sharing an observation, a piece of feedback, or a lesson learned. This is NOT a request for work to be done. It is a signal that the governance system should grow.

The governance learning pipeline is:

```
Observation → Lesson artifact → Pattern check → Rule (if recurring) → Enforcement
```

This mode is the entry point to that pipeline. Missing it means the observation is lost — it never becomes a lesson, never becomes a rule, and never becomes enforcement. That is why it is the most important mode to detect correctly.

## When It Activates

The orchestrator routes here when the user is narrating a pattern they've noticed rather than requesting an action.

Typical signals:
- "I noticed that X keeps happening"
- "we should always do Y from now on"
- "that approach caused problems — let's not do it again"
- "remember this for next time"
- "can we make sure this doesn't happen again"
- "for future reference, the right way to do this is..."
- "this is a pattern I keep seeing across sessions"

## What the Agent Needs

The governance steward role handles learning loop work:

1. **Capture** — write a lesson artifact in `.orqa/process/lessons/` with the observation documented
2. **Check recurrence** — search existing lessons for the same pattern. If it has occurred before, promotion to a rule is required.
3. **Promote if recurring** — create or update a RULE artifact with a full enforcement chain
4. **Enforcement chain** — a rule without enforcement is just documentation. The chain must close: rule → linter/hook/gate/injection

## How It Connects to the Thinking Framework

Learning Loop Mode is the governance intake for the entire framework:

- **Debugging Mode** may route here when a root cause reveals a systemic governance gap
- **Review Mode** may route here when a FAIL verdict reveals a missing rule
- **Research Mode** may route here when investigation reveals an anti-pattern worth naming

The learning loop is what makes OrqaStudio's governance compound over time. Every observation that is captured and promoted strengthens the system for all future sessions.

## Governance

- Lesson artifacts live in `.orqa/process/lessons/` with `type: lesson`
- Recurring lessons (seen 2+ times) MUST be promoted to rules — this is non-negotiable
- RULE-009 (dogfood mode): enforcement gaps discovered during development are immediately CRITICAL
