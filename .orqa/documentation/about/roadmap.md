**Date:** 2026-03-07

> OrqaStudio™ is an AI-assisted clarity engine that helps people turn messy situations into structured understanding and evolving plans through agile thinking and continuous retrospection.

This roadmap is structured around two milestones and a feature enhancement backlog:

1. **Milestone 1: Dogfooding** [MS-001](MS-001) — OrqaStudio is usable as a daily workspace for its own development
2. **Milestone 2: MVP** [MS-002](MS-002) — Someone else can use OrqaStudio to fulfil the mission statement
3. **Feature Enhancements** — Future ideas ([IDEA-001](IDEA-001) through [IDEA-022](IDEA-022)) that enhance the platform beyond MVP

Items within milestones are prioritised using the framework defined below. All items are tracked as first-class artifacts in `.orqa/` — see [Artifact Framework](artifact-framework.md) for schemas and structure.

---

## Prioritisation Framework

Every backlog item is scored on four dimensions. The composite score determines ordering within milestones.

| Dimension | Scale | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **Pillar Alignment** | 0-5 | x3 | How strongly this serves Clarity Through Structure and/or Learning Through Reflection. 0=neither, 3=one pillar, 5=both pillars. |
| **User Impact** | 1-5 | x2 | How much this changes the daily experience for the target user. |
| **Dependency** | 1-3 | x3 | How many other items are blocked by this. 1=independent, 2=some dependents, 3=critical path. |
| **Effort** | 1-5 | divisor | Implementation size. Larger effort = lower score. Prevents big items from always winning. |

**Score = (Pillar x 3 + Impact x 2 + Dependency x 3) / Effort**

Priority bands derived from score:

| Band | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **P1** | Critical path — milestone blocked without this |
| **P2** | High value — significant quality improvement |
| **P3** | Nice to have — improves experience but not blocking |

This framework will be built into OrqaStudio itself as an MVP feature (see Milestone 2), enabling structured prioritisation for any project.

## Milestone 1: Dogfooding

**Goal:** OrqaStudio is usable as a daily workspace for building OrqaStudio itself.

**Gate question:** *"Can we use this app instead of the terminal for governance management, conversation debugging, and structured thinking about the project?"*

**Dogfooding context:** OrqaStudio is developed using itself (`.orqa/project.json` has `dogfood: true`). The app runs with `--no-watch` so editing Rust files doesn't kill the active session. Frontend changes hot-reload via Vite HMR. Rust changes require manual restart.

### P1 — Critical Path

These items block dogfooding. Each represents a gap between "the pieces exist" and "it actually works end-to-end."

#### D1. AI Transparency Wiring — [EPIC-001](EPIC-001) (Done)

The types, components, and store handling all exist. The emission logic now connects them.

- [x] Emit `SystemPromptSent` event from `stream_commands.rs` [TASK-001](TASK-001)
- [x] Verify end-to-end rendering pipeline [TASK-002](TASK-002)
- [x] Update streaming pipeline documentation [TASK-003](TASK-003)
- [x] Emit `ContextInjected` event when prior messages exist in session [TASK-004](TASK-004)

**Completed:** `SystemPromptSent` emitted before sidecar request. Full pipeline verified: Rust emission → Channel<T> → store accumulation → ContextEntry + ContextDetailDialog rendering. ThinkingBlock already wired. `ContextInjected` emission deferred to [EPIC-003](EPIC-003).

#### D2. Settings UI for Thinking & Custom Prompt

Fields exist in both Rust and TypeScript. Missing: UI controls to set them.

- [ ] Add `show_thinking` toggle in Settings > Model section
- [ ] Add `custom_system_prompt` textarea in Settings > Project section
- [ ] Add "View auto-generated prompt" collapsible preview (reuse `build_system_prompt()`)

**Why P1:** Can't control reasoning behaviour without these toggles.

#### D3. Context Injection on Failed Resume

SDK session resume works on the happy path. Missing: fallback when SDK state is lost (app restart, cleared storage).

- [ ] Detect SDK resume failure in sidecar (returned session_id !== passed session_id)
- [ ] Sidecar emits `context_needed` event to Rust
- [ ] Rust loads last ~20 text messages from SQLite for the session
- [ ] Rust sends `context_history` to sidecar for injection
- [ ] Rust emits `ContextInjected` event for transparency (D1)

**Why P1:** Can't restart the app during development without losing conversation context.

#### D4. Artifact Editing UI

Backend CRUD exists (`artifact_create`, `artifact_update`, `artifact_delete`). Read-only viewers exist. Missing: an editor component.

- [ ] CodeMirror 6 editor component for markdown/YAML editing
- [ ] Edit mode toggle on artifact viewers (view → edit)
- [ ] Create new artifact from template (agents, rules, skills, hooks)
- [ ] Delete artifact with confirmation dialog
- [ ] Wire artifact store methods to backend CRUD commands

**Why P1:** Can't manage governance in-app without editing. Currently requires switching to a text editor.

#### D5. Artifact Browser & Visibility

Make `.orqa/` artifacts (milestones, epics, ideas, plans, research, lessons) browsable as rendered markdown documents in OrqaStudio's UI. This is the **underlying UX model** — all richer views are optional layers built on top.

- [ ] `.orqa/` directory scanner — read and parse all artifact types
- [ ] Frontmatter parser — extract YAML frontmatter into structured data
- [ ] Artifact browser sidebar — tree navigation by type
- [ ] Markdown renderer view — render artifact body with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Frontmatter metadata panel — display structured metadata alongside the document
- [ ] Connection links — clickable references to related artifacts
- [ ] Status badges and priority band indicators

**Why P1:** Structured thinking artifacts must be visible in the app. Markdown-first visibility is the foundational UX layer that all other views build upon.

### P2 — Enablers

These significantly improve dogfooding quality but aren't strict blockers.

#### D6. File Watcher for External Changes

- [ ] Add `notify` crate for filesystem watching
- [ ] Watch `.claude/` and `.orqa/` directories for external modifications
- [ ] Refresh artifact list and viewer when files change on disk
- [ ] Debounce rapid changes (editor auto-save)

**Why P2:** Without this, CLI edits to governance files aren't reflected in the app until manual refresh.

#### D7. Composability Refactoring

The codebase has solid boundaries (stores, IPC, components) but monolithic service files.

- [ ] Extract `StreamOrchestrator` from `stream_commands.rs` (2,232 lines → command handlers + orchestrator service)
- [ ] Implement `Tool` trait and `ToolRegistry` from `tool_executor.rs` (966 lines → pluggable tools)
- [ ] Decompose `ConversationView.svelte` (367 lines) into smaller composable units if complexity grows
- [ ] Service layer for enforcement, governance, and scanning (wrap procedural code in structs)

**Why P2:** Code health for sustained velocity. Functions individually pass size limits, but file-level cohesion is poor.

#### D8. Code Quality Audit

- [ ] Coding standards compliance audit against `.orqa/documentation/development/coding-standards.md`
- [ ] Enforcement artifact review — rules/hooks/skills completeness
- [ ] Abstraction pattern audit — identify over-complicated patterns from iterative development
- [ ] Fix function size violations in `tool_executor.rs` (`tool_bash` 97 lines, `execute_tool` 69 lines, `project_root_from_state` 152 lines)

**Why P2:** Can't credibly enforce quality on managed projects if our own code has violations.

#### D9. Frontend Test Suite

- [ ] Vitest setup for Svelte component and store testing
- [ ] Store unit tests (conversation, session, project, settings — state transitions, reactive updates)
- [ ] Component tests for critical UI (ConversationView, ToolApprovalDialog, SessionDropdown)
- [ ] IPC contract tests — verify invoke calls match actual Tauri commands

**Why P2:** 465 Rust tests exist but zero frontend tests. Changes to stores break components silently.

### P3 — Polish

#### D10. Developer Experience

- [ ] Project-local database — move SQLite from `app_data_dir` to `.orqa/orqa.db` so session history travels with the project
- [ ] Build splash window — small branded window during `make dev` compilation
- [ ] Custom system prompt templates — pre-built prompts for common scenarios (dogfooding, greenfield, legacy)

---

## Milestone 2: MVP

**Goal:** Someone other than the developer can use OrqaStudio to fulfil the mission statement — both a technical PM managing a software project and someone doing non-software structured thinking.

**Gate question:** *"Can a new user install this, open a project (or create one), and get value from AI-assisted structured thinking within 10 minutes?"*

**Prerequisites:** Milestone 1 complete. The app is stable enough for daily use by its own team.

### P1 — Core Experience

Minimum for someone else to get value from OrqaStudio.

#### M1. Chat-Guided Onboarding

No directed onboarding flows needed — the chat itself guides new users through setup.

- [ ] System prompt includes project state awareness (what artifacts exist, what's configured, what's missing)
- [ ] AI suggests next steps when project is new or incomplete ("I notice you don't have any rules defined yet — would you like to...")
- [ ] First-conversation guidance — when no sessions exist, AI introduces OrqaStudio's capabilities naturally
- [ ] Entry mode detection — AI identifies which mode (Problem, Idea, Goal, Chaos) fits the user's opening message and adapts accordingly

**Why P1:** The conversation IS the onboarding. Without this, new users don't know what to do.

#### M2. Process Visibility Dashboard

Governance coverage exists. Missing: richer process visibility.

- [ ] Scanner runner — execute code quality checks (clippy, eslint, tests) and collect results
- [ ] Scanner dashboard — pass/fail history, violation details, trend charts (LayerChart)
- [ ] Metrics dashboard — KPI cards for key project health indicators
- [ ] Agent activity panel — which agent is active, what tools it's using, current task

**Why P1:** Pillar 1 (Clarity Through Structure) — governance must be visible, not buried in terminal output.

#### M3. Learning Through Reflection

Lesson management exists (CRUD, UI). Missing: the automated capture and promotion pipeline.

- [ ] Post-session hooks that capture lessons automatically to `.orqa/process/lessons/`
- [ ] Rules enforcing lesson checking before implementation
- [ ] Automated promotion suggestions when recurrence >= threshold
- [ ] Lesson dashboard with recurrence trends (LayerChart)
- [ ] Session analytics — pass/fail rates, coverage trends

**Why P1:** Pillar 2 (Learning Through Reflection) — the system must get smarter with each cycle.

#### M4. Project Type System

OrqaStudio's governance applies to any project, not just software. The app needs to know what kind of project it's managing.

- [ ] `project_type` field in `.orqa/project.json` and `ProjectSettings` — Software, Research, Product, Personal, Custom
- [ ] Project type determines which agents, tools, and scanning are available
- [ ] Software projects get code tools (ChunkHound, file tools, git); others get domain-appropriate tooling
- [ ] Non-software projects work without requiring a codebase
- [ ] Project type selector in project creation/settings

**Why P1:** Without this, non-software users encounter software-specific features that don't apply to them.

#### M5. CI/CD Pipeline & Distribution

Must be distributable for anyone else to use it.

- [ ] GitHub Actions: PR checks (`make check` on all platforms)
- [ ] GitHub Actions: build artifacts on merge to main (pre-release)
- [ ] GitHub Actions: build release on tag push (stable)
- [ ] Platform matrix: Windows (x64), macOS (x64, arm64), Linux (x64)
- [ ] Artifact signing with Tauri updater keys
- [ ] Semantic versioning: tauri.conf.json + Cargo.toml + package.json sync
- [ ] Auto-update via `tauri-plugin-updater` with GitHub Releases
- [ ] Update channel selector in Settings (pre-release / stable)

**Why P1:** Can't ship to users without a build pipeline and update mechanism.

#### M6. Prioritisation Framework

The scoring model defined above, built into the app.

- [ ] Priority dimensions — user configures dimensions and weights in `.orqa/project.json`
- [ ] Default dimensions: Impact (x2), Effort (x2, inverted), Urgency (x2), Pillar Alignment (x3)
- [ ] Composite priority score — weighted sum produces comparable number across all item types
- [ ] Priority bands — score ranges map to P0-P4 labels
- [ ] Auto-scoring — suggest dimension scores based on frontmatter when items are created
- [ ] Manual override with tracking
- [ ] Priority views — backlog sorted by composite score, filterable by band
- [ ] Custom dimensions — users add project-specific scoring dimensions

**Why P1:** OrqaStudio is a structured thinking tool. Prioritisation is a core structured thinking capability.

### P2 — Depth

Richer experience and broader use cases.

#### M7. Enforcement & Continuity

- [ ] Hooks that inject relevant rules into conversations based on file context
- [ ] Real-time violation detection during streaming (pattern matching on streamed tokens)
- [ ] Visual compliance dashboard
- [ ] Session handoff and continuity — cross-session search, handoff summaries

#### M8. Sub-Agent Support

- [ ] Agent registry — reads `.orqa/agents/*.md`, indexes capabilities
- [ ] `spawn_agent` tool — spawns sub-agent with role and instructions
- [ ] Explore mode — lightweight codebase exploration agent (no tool approval)
- [ ] Output aggregation — child tool calls collected, summary card with expandable detail
- [ ] Turn limits — configurable max turns per sub-agent invocation

#### M9. MCP Host — External Servers

- [ ] MCP host module — JSON-RPC protocol handler, connection state machine
- [ ] stdio transport — spawn external MCP servers, process lifecycle management
- [ ] SSE transport — HTTP client for remote MCP servers
- [ ] Config loader — merge project + user MCP server configs
- [ ] Tool aggregator — merge built-in + external tools, namespace external tools
- [ ] MCP Servers section in Settings — server list, add/remove, test connection, trust levels

#### M10. Discovery & Research Artifacts

- [ ] Research artifact type — structured, queryable, filterable
- [ ] Decision traceability graph (research → AD → feature → implementation)
- [ ] Research-to-AD promotion workflow
- [ ] Discovery dashboard — open questions, pending decisions
- [ ] Conversational research workflow — Claude-assisted investigation producing structured artifacts

#### M11. Idea & Feedback Capture

- [ ] Idea artifact type in `.orqa/delivery/ideas/` with frontmatter
- [ ] Quick-capture from conversation — slash command or highlight to create idea
- [ ] Quick-capture from anywhere — global shortcut or status bar button
- [ ] Idea inbox — uncategorised ideas, sortable
- [ ] Idea-to-research and idea-to-plan promotion
- [ ] Duplicate detection via FTS5 + semantic search

#### M12. Implementation Breakdown & Work Management

- [ ] Epic → Backlog Item → Task hierarchy
- [ ] Plan-to-backlog breakdown with Claude assistance
- [ ] Unified backlog view — bugs and features together, filterable, sortable
- [ ] Status workflow — draft → ready → in-progress → review → done
- [ ] Bug artifact type in `.orqa/bugs/` with reproduction steps
- [ ] Task-to-agent assignment and worktree branch generation
- [ ] Progress dashboard — plan completion %, epic progress

#### M13. Onboarding Flow Review

- [ ] Audit first-run setup wizard — verify each step is clear and skippable
- [ ] New Project flow — scaffold sensible project structure with optional templates
- [ ] Initialize Existing Folder — improve scan results presentation
- [ ] Guided first conversation — suggest first task after project setup
- [ ] Open Project validation — graceful handling of corrupted `.orqa/`

### P3 — Nice to Have for Launch

#### M14. Additional Polish

- [ ] Semantic search index management UI — trigger re-index, show status, configure patterns
- [ ] Multi-window / multi-project — system tray, per-window sidecar lifecycle
- [ ] Composability Gate phases C+D — composable learning loop, initialization assessment
- [ ] Sprint/iteration planning — optional timeboxing, burndown
- [ ] Dependency tracking between backlog items
