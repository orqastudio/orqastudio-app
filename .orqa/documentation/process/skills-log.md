**Date:** 2026-03-02

This page tracks all installed skills in the OrqaStudio™ project -- their source, purpose, and when they were added. It is maintained by the `agent-maintainer` agent.

Skills are stored in `.orqa/skills/` and follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard.

## Source Categories

| Category | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `skills.sh` | Downloaded directly from the skills.sh ecosystem -- fully portable, no project-specific content | tauri-v2, svelte5-best-practices, typescript-advanced-types, rust-async-patterns, tailwind-design-system |
| `skills.sh + modified` | Started as a skills.sh skill but modified for OrqaStudio patterns | (none yet) |
| `Custom (adapted)` | Adapted from Alvarez project for OrqaStudio's architecture and workflow | chunkhound, planning, architecture, skills-maintenance |

## Portability Rules

**All skills must be portable technology knowledge.** A skill is portable if it would be useful in a different project using the same technology stack.

**Portable (allowed in skills):**

- How Svelte 5 `$state` reactivity works
- How to write a Rust module with proper error handling
- How to structure a cargo test with fixtures
- How ChunkHound's three search modes work

**Not portable (must go in docs, agent instructions, or rules):**

- Any architecture decision or OrqaStudio architectural rule
- Any reference to `$lib/components/shared/` or OrqaStudio-specific paths
- Any OrqaStudio-specific Tauri command patterns
- Any product pillar or governance rule

The `agent-maintainer` audits skills periodically for portability violations. Any OrqaStudio-specific content found in a skill is extracted to the appropriate destination (docs, rules, or agent instructions).

## Skill Lifecycle

1. **Discovery** -- Find a skill need during a task. Search skills.sh: `npx skills find <query>`
2. **Installation** -- `npx skills add <source> -y` (installs to `.orqa/skills/`)
3. **Documentation** -- Add entry to this skills-log.md with source, purpose, and date
4. **Loading** -- Add to relevant agent YAML frontmatter `skills:` list
5. **Updates** -- `npx skills check` to see available updates, `npx skills update` to apply
6. **Deprecation** -- When a skill is superseded or its domain is gone, mark it and remove after one session
7. **Removal** -- `npx skills remove <name>` and remove from skills-log.md and all agent frontmatter

For full lifecycle management guidance, load the `skills-maintenance` skill.

## Pillar Alignment

| Pillar | Alignment |
|--------|-----------|
| Clarity Through Structure | N/A |
| Learning Through Reflection | The skill inventory tracks what technology knowledge is available to agents, and the lifecycle process ensures skills are updated, audited for portability, and retired when superseded — keeping agent capability current as the project evolves. |
