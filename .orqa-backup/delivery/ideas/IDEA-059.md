## Description

OrqaStudio's plugin architecture needs a way for plugins to create custom views. Currently, shared components live in `$lib/components/shared/` but are only available to the core app. Plugins need:

1. **Component library SDK** — shared components (EmptyState, StatusIndicator, etc.) as an importable library
2. **Artifact Graph SDK** — already exists (`artifact-graph.svelte.ts`), needs documentation
3. **View registration API** — plugins register custom views for artifact types or dashboard panels
4. **Theme tokens** — plugins access the design system tokens

See [RES-046](RES-046) for context on plugin architecture requirements.
