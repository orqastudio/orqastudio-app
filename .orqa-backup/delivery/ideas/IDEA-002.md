## Candidate Items

- Generic governance format — agents, rules, skills, hooks in `.orqa/process/` as canonical source
- Claude Code adapter — `.claude/` references `.orqa/process/` content
- Continue adapter — `.continue/` directory adapter
- Cursor adapter — `.cursor/` directory adapter
- Other environment adapters — pattern for any AI tool with directory-based config
- Remove Claude-specific language from governance
- Migration tooling — automated migration from `.claude/` to `.orqa/` + adapter pattern
