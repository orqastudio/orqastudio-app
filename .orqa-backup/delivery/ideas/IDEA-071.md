## Motivation

[RES-052](RES-052) established the design decisions for plugin-provider pairing, capability fulfilment, and plugin type taxonomy. These decisions need implementation:

- Plugin type system (array of types, extendable enum, type-specific requires shape)
- AI provider definitions in `.orqa/providers/` (identity, detection, required plugins)
- Capability routing per-project with plugin-provided defaults and app baseline
- Plugin installation that wires capabilities, skills, and agent updates as a complete package
- Load-time filtering of non-matching plugins based on active AI provider
- Bidirectional provider-plugin relationship (providers declare required plugins, plugins declare supported providers)

This is the implementation companion to [IDEA-069](IDEA-069) (sidecar-as-plugin), which would eventually merge provider definitions into plugins themselves.
