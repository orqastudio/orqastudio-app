## What

A `WorkflowTracker` struct that accumulates session events relevant to process
gate evaluation. Process gates query this tracker to determine if prerequisites
are met before allowing transitions (e.g., "has the agent read any docs before
writing code?").

## How

1. Create `backend/src-tauri/src/domain/workflow_tracker.rs`
2. Define `WorkflowTracker` with: files_read, files_written, searches_performed,
   docs_consulted, skills_loaded, commands_run, turn_count
3. Add methods: `record_read()`, `record_write()`, `record_search()`, etc.
4. Add query methods: `has_read_docs()`, `has_searched()`, `has_loaded_skills()`
5. Wire into the domain module

## Verification

- Struct compiles and passes unit tests
- Query methods return correct results after recording events
- Tracker resets per session (not per turn)
