## What

Create the `orqa-plugin` repository with the Claude Code plugin scaffold.
This is the foundation all other [EPIC-050](EPIC-050) tasks build on.

## How

1. Create new repository `orqa-plugin`
2. Add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest
3. Create directory structure: hooks/, commands/, agents/, skills/, core/
4. Add README with plugin purpose and installation instructions
5. Verify Claude Code can discover and load the plugin

## Verification

- `plugin.json` is valid and Claude Code recognises the plugin
- All required directories exist
- README explains installation
