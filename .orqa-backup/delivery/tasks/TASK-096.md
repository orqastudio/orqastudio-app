## What

Evaluated frontend framework and library options, selecting Svelte 5 with its runes system for reactive state, shadcn-svelte as the component library, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## How

Compared Svelte 5 runes against React hooks and Vue's composition API, assessed shadcn-svelte's maturity and component coverage, and validated Tailwind integration with the Vite build pipeline.

## Verification

Svelte 5 runes-only policy was established as a coding standard and shadcn-svelte was confirmed as the primary component library.
