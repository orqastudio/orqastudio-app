acceptance:
  - Rust module loads rules from .orqa/process/rules/
  - Module parses YAML frontmatter including enforcement array
  - Module evaluates patterns against tool call context
  - Module returns block/warn/allow decisions
  - Unit tests cover loading, parsing, and pattern matching

## What

Port the companion plugin's rule engine logic to Rust so the app can enforce
rules natively without depending on the CLI plugin.

## How

1. Create `backend/src-tauri/src/domain/enforcement.rs` module
2. Implement rule loading from filesystem (reuse artifact scanner frontmatter parsing)
3. Implement enforcement pattern evaluation using `regex` crate
4. Implement decision logic (block/warn/allow)
5. Write unit tests

## Verification

- `cargo test` passes for enforcement module
- Engine produces same decisions as the plugin for the same rule set
