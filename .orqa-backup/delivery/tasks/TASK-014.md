## What

Add ONNX-based embedding generation and semantic (vector similarity) search
to the native search engine.

## Outcome

Implemented as `search_semantic` Tauri command. Embedder uses `ort` crate with
DirectML execution provider. 384-dimensional vectors stored in DuckDB.
Git commit: `69a9ae3`.

## How

Implementation approach defined by the assignee.

## Verification

Acceptance criteria verified by reviewer.
