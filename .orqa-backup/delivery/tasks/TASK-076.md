acceptance:
  - artifact.svelte.ts uses artifactGraph.readContent() instead of invoke('read_artifact')
  - viewerCache removed — SDK reads from disk, no frontend caching
  - ARTIFACT_PREFIX_MAP removed from navigation.svelte.ts
  - pendingArtifactId replaced with artifactGraph.resolve(id).path + navigateToPath()
