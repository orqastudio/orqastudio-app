title: "Documentation reorganisation — book-chapter structure with how-to guides"
description: "Reorganise .orqa/documentation/ from ad-hoc sections (architecture/, product/, process/, ui/, wireframes/) into book chapters (about/, guide/, development/, how-to/, reference/, grounding/). Write missing how-to guides for plugin SDK, testing, and linting. Migrate relationships and project.json paths."

## Context

RES-063 produced a complete migration inventory: 58 files mapped, 46 need moving. The architecture/ and process/ directories dissolve. product/ becomes about/. ui/ and wireframes/ consolidate into reference/. A new how-to/ chapter needs 10 guides written (3 P1).

DOC-ID relationships (187 references) are stable across moves. 152 body-text path references across 71 files need updating.

## Implementation Design

### Migration Strategy (per RES-063 recommendation: atomic per source directory)

1. Move product/ → about/ (11 files)
2. Move architecture/ → development/ and reference/ (18 files)
3. Move process/ → guide/, about/, development/, reference/ (6 files)
4. Move ui/ → reference/ (6 files)
5. Move wireframes/ → reference/wireframes/ (5 files)
6. Update project.json artifact config
7. Sweep body-text path references
8. Write P1 how-to guides
9. Add grounding/ to project.json (pre-existing gap)

## Tasks

- [ ] [TASK-484](TASK-484): Move product/ → about/ (11 files) + update project.json
- [ ] [TASK-485](TASK-485): Move architecture/ → development/ and reference/ (18 files) + assign missing DOC IDs
- [ ] [TASK-486](TASK-486): Move process/ and ui/ and wireframes/ → target chapters (17 files)
- [ ] [TASK-487](TASK-487): Sweep body-text path references across all .orqa/ files
- [ ] [TASK-488](TASK-488): Write P1 how-to guides (plugin SDK, Rust testing, frontend testing)
- [ ] [TASK-489](TASK-489): Add grounding/ to project.json + create chapter READMEs
