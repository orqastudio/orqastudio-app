title: "Configuration-driven delivery pipeline"
description: "Replace hardcoded delivery artifact types (milestones, epics, tasks) with project-configurable type definitions in project.json. The code becomes a generic enforcement engine for whatever delivery pipeline the project defines. Core artifacts (ideas, research, rules, lessons, decisions, skills, agents, pillars) remain hardcoded as firmware."

## Context

Currently the codebase hardcodes knowledge of delivery artifact types:
- Rust integrity checks reference "epic", "milestone", "task" field names directly
- Roadmap components have hardcoded EPIC_COLUMNS, TASK_COLUMNS
- Parent-child relationships (task→epic→milestone) are hardcoded
- The StatusKanban groups by hardcoded status values

Per AD-051, the delivery pipeline should be configurable. A software project defines milestones/epics/tasks. A different project might define phases/workstreams/actions.

## Implementation Design

### Phase 1: Define delivery type configuration schema

Add a `delivery` section to `project.json`:
```json
{
  "delivery": {
    "types": [
      {
        "key": "milestone",
        "label": "Milestone",
        "path": ".orqa/delivery/milestones",
        "parent": null
      },
      {
        "key": "epic",
        "label": "Epic",
        "path": ".orqa/delivery/epics",
        "parent": { "type": "milestone", "field": "milestone" }
      },
      {
        "key": "task",
        "label": "Task",
        "path": ".orqa/delivery/tasks",
        "parent": { "type": "epic", "field": "epic" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Make integrity checks config-driven

Replace hardcoded field references in `artifact_graph.rs` with lookups against the delivery type config. The parent-child consistency check reads the hierarchy from config, not from hardcoded "epic"/"milestone" strings.

### Phase 3: Make roadmap components config-driven

Roadmap reads delivery types from config to determine:
- Which type is the top level (milestones)
- Which type is the second level (epics)
- Which type is the third level (tasks)
- Column definitions derived from configured statuses

### Phase 4: Validate current artifacts against configuration

Ensure all existing delivery artifacts conform to the configured type definitions.
