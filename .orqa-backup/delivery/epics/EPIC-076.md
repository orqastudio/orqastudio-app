## Context

Cytoscape.js is now installed for graph visualization. It includes built-in graph analysis algorithms (components, centrality, PageRank, BFS/DFS, shortest path) that can power governance insights far beyond the current file-based integrity scanning.

## Implementation Design

### Architecture

A headless Cytoscape instance in the artifact graph SDK runs analysis without requiring DOM rendering. Results are exposed as reactive state that dashboard widgets consume.

```
Artifact Graph SDK
  → buildAnalysisCy() — headless cytoscape instance from graph data
  → graphHealth — { componentCount, orphanPercentage, avgDegree, largestComponentRatio }
  → backboneArtifacts — top N by PageRank
  → traceChain(id, direction) — BFS upward/downward from any artifact
  → impactOf(id) — all artifacts affected by a change to this one
  → knowledgeGaps — per-type unlinked artifact lists
```

### Phases

Phase 1: Graph health scoring + headless analysis in SDK
Phase 2: Dependency chain tracing in artifact viewer
Phase 3: Impact analysis panel
Phase 4: Backbone artifacts widget
Phase 5: Knowledge gap detection

## Tasks
