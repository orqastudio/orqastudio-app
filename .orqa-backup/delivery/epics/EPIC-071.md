## Context

UAT round 2 found documentation navigation shows status (irrelevant for docs), Guide section is empty, doc ordering is arbitrary, and the markdown renderer lacks diagram support. Documentation pages also need proper graph relationships.

## Tasks

- [TASK-451](TASK-451): Fix docs nav — show top-level categories instead of status
- [TASK-452](TASK-452): Populate Guide section — icon, move appropriate articles, add SDK docs
- [TASK-453](TASK-453): Audit and reorder documentation for structured reading flow
- [TASK-454](TASK-454): Mermaid and PlantUML rendering in markdown, themed to match app
- [TASK-455](TASK-455): Documentation relationship audit — add documents/documented-by edges

## Out of Scope

- Documentation editing UI (future)
