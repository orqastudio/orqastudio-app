**Date:** 2026-03-02

Canonical definitions for terms used throughout OrqaStudio™ documentation. All product, design, and technical documents should use these terms consistently. If a new term is introduced, add it here first.

---

## Core Concepts

### Session

A single conversation between the user and an AI provider through OrqaStudio. A session has a start time, an optional end time, a sequence of messages, and belongs to a project. Sessions are persisted in SQLite and are searchable via FTS5.

**Not:** A login session or application lifecycle. "Session" always means a conversation session.

### Message

A single unit within a session. Messages have a role (user, assistant, system, tool_call, tool_result), content (one or more content blocks), and a timestamp. Messages are stored as one row per content block for granular search and rendering.

### Content Block

A typed segment within a message: text, code, tool call, tool result, image, or error. The atomic unit of persistence — each content block is a row in the `message_blocks` table.

### Project

A codebase and its associated governance framework that the user manages through OrqaStudio. A project has a root directory, a set of governance artifacts, sessions, and configuration. A user may have multiple projects.

### Workspace

The runtime state of an open project in OrqaStudio: the active session, open panels, selected artifacts, and UI layout. Workspace state is ephemeral (window-state plugin handles persistence across restarts).

---

## Governance Artifacts

### Artifact

Any structured document that defines how a project operates. Governance artifacts include agents, rules, skills, hooks, hookify files, and documentation. Artifacts live on disk in `.orqa/` (authoritative source of truth) and are indexed in SQLite (derived cache). For CLI tool compatibility, OrqaStudio can optionally create symlinks in `.claude/` or other tool-specific locations pointing to the corresponding `.orqa/` paths.

### Agent

A specialized AI persona with a defined role, skill set, and domain boundary. Agents are defined as markdown files (`.orqa/agents/*.md`) with YAML frontmatter specifying skills and capabilities. Agents are provider-agnostic definitions that the sidecar instantiates. In the current bootstrap process, agents are executed through the Claude Code CLI via `.claude/` symlinks pointing to `.orqa/agents/`.

**Examples:** backend-engineer, frontend-engineer, code-reviewer, systems-architect.

### Rule

A constraint that agents must follow during implementation. Rules are markdown files (`.orqa/rules/*.md`) that encode coding standards, workflow requirements, architectural constraints, and process gates. Rules are the primary mechanism for enforcing governance.

**Examples:** "All Rust code must use Result types, not unwrap," "Every task must pass through a review gate before completion."

### Skill

A reusable knowledge package that provides domain-specific context to agents. Skills are loaded on demand and supply agents with framework-specific patterns, best practices, and reference material. Skills come from the skills.sh registry or custom project definitions.

**Examples:** svelte5-best-practices, rust-async-patterns, tauri-v2, chunkhound.

### Hook

A governance enforcement mechanism triggered automatically during development. OrqaStudio supports two types of hooks:

**Lifecycle hooks** (`.orqa/process/hooks/`) — Shell scripts that execute in response to lifecycle events (session start, stop). Used for process reminders and checklists.

**Hookify rules** (`.orqa/hooks/hookify.*.local.md`) — Pattern-based enforcement files that block or warn in real-time when a file edit or bash command matches a forbidden pattern. Used for active prevention of code-level violations. For Claude Code CLI compatibility, these may be symlinked from `.claude/hookify.*.local.md`.

Both types appear in the Hooks view of the Activity Bar.

### Documentation

Structured project knowledge maintained in `.orqa/documentation/` (the canonical location). During the bootstrap phase, documentation is also maintained in `docs/` and will migrate to `.orqa/documentation/` as the artifact framework matures. Documentation covers architecture decisions, research findings, process definitions, UI specifications, and product definitions. Documentation is the foundation layer — agents, rules, and skills reference docs, not the other way around.

---

## Process Concepts

### Governance Framework

The complete set of artifacts (agents, rules, skills, hooks, hookify files, documentation) that define how a project operates. All governance artifacts live under `.orqa/` as the source of truth. The governance framework is the product that OrqaStudio makes visible and manageable. It is organized in four layers: **Core** (app-managed, non-editable — provides the core systems thinking framework), **Project** (user-managed, additive — extends the core for a specific context), **Plugin** (1st party official extensions), and **Community** (community-contributed extensions). Core artifacts and project artifacts may be backed by `.orqa/` files; the plugin and community layers add capability without file-system footprint.

### Two-Pillar Test

The feature acceptance gate: every feature must serve at least one of (1) Clarity Through Structure or (2) Learning Through Reflection. Features that serve neither are rejected. When pillars conflict, Pillar 1 takes priority — you cannot improve a process that isn't visible and structured. See Product Governance.

### Clarity Through Structure (Pillar 1)

Making governance artifacts visible and manageable. Producing structured knowledge (plans, decisions, rules). Surfacing what would otherwise be hidden in files or terminal output. Enforcing documentation-first workflows. Rule enforcement and visualisation, agent definition management, scanner execution and dashboards, quality gate enforcement. Governance is not a document collecting dust — it is a living, enforceable, visible layer that OrqaStudio makes tangible and manageable.

### Learning Through Reflection (Pillar 2)

The system and its users improving over time. Lesson capture, metric tracking (pass/fail rates, coverage trends, violation recurrence), retrospective generation, pattern promotion (lesson → rule → scanner → enforcement), session continuity and handoff, codebase scanning and re-scanning, knowledge accumulation over time. Mistakes are documented, patterns are extracted, and governance artifacts are updated automatically.

### Human Approval Gate

The requirement that implementation plans must be approved by a human (Product Manager or Tech Lead) before coding begins. Agents plan and implement, but humans authorize. This is a foundational principle.

### Documentation-First Workflow

The mandate that all significant work follows: Document → Approve → Implement → Verify. No implementation begins without approved documentation. No feature is complete without verified documentation.

---

## Implementation Cycle

### Implementation Plan

A structured proposal for how a task will be implemented. Includes scope, approach, affected files, testing strategy, and acceptance criteria. Must be approved by the human user (acting as PM/Tech Lead) before coding begins.

### Review Gate

A verification checkpoint after implementation completes. The standard gate involves code review, QA testing, and UX review (if UI-facing). Each reviewer produces a PASS/FAIL verdict with evidence.

### Definition of Ready (DoR)

A checklist that must be satisfied before implementation begins. Includes understanding of requirements, documentation approval, and dependency identification.

### Definition of Done (DoD)

A checklist that must be satisfied before a task is marked complete. Includes build verification, test coverage, review gate passage, and documentation updates.

### Scanner

An automated quality check that evaluates the codebase or governance framework against defined standards. Scanners run periodically or on-demand and produce structured pass/fail results. Scanner results are persisted and visualized as trends.

**Examples:** Lint compliance scanner, test coverage scanner, architecture decision compliance scanner.

---

## Learning Loop Concepts

### Lesson (IMPL Entry)

A documented implementation-level learning captured when something goes wrong or a non-obvious pattern is discovered. Individual lesson files stored in `.orqa/process/lessons/` as `IMPL-NNN.md` with a recurrence count and promotion status. Format: `IMPL-NNN`.

### Retrospective (RETRO Entry)

A documented process-level learning that records a problem, root cause, corrective action, and outcome. Retrospectives inform governance evolution. Format: `RETRO-NNN`.

### Promotion

The act of elevating a lesson or pattern into a permanent governance artifact. When an IMPL entry recurs (count >= 2), it is promoted to a rule, coding standard, or skill update. Promotion closes the learning loop.

### Cross-Project Learning

The mechanism by which lessons learned in one project are made available to other projects. Lessons can be promoted from project-local to global scope. When onboarding a new project, OrqaStudio consults global lessons for relevant patterns.

### Global Lesson

A lesson that has been promoted from project scope to global scope. Global lessons apply across all projects managed by OrqaStudio. Example: "Always use constant-time comparison for password hashing" is universally applicable regardless of project.

### Metric (KPI)

A quantitative measurement of process health. Metrics include review failure rate, lesson promotion rate, DoR/DoD compliance, context window incidents, and build verification pass rate. Metrics are tracked over time and visualized in the dashboard.

## Architecture Concepts

### Sidecar

A standalone process that handles communication with an AI provider. The sidecar is a Bun-compiled TypeScript binary that OrqaStudio spawns via `tauri-plugin-shell`. It communicates with the Rust backend over stdin/stdout using NDJSON. The sidecar is provider-specific; the Rust core is provider-agnostic.

### Model

A specific AI model used for a conversation session (e.g., a frontier model, a smaller model, or a reasoning model — the exact names depend on the configured AI provider). Users select a model per-session via a dropdown in the session header. The special value `"auto"` delegates model selection to the provider, which chooses the best available model based on current rate limits and availability. When auto is active, the status bar displays the resolved model name so the user always knows which model is actually responding.

### Auto Model Selection

Provider-managed model routing. When a session's model is set to `"auto"`, the sidecar delegates model selection to the provider SDK rather than specifying a model explicitly. The provider chooses based on current rate limits, availability, and subscription tier. Auto is the default when the provider supports it. Not all providers support auto — the provider interface exposes a `supports_auto_model` capability flag. If the provider does not support auto, the user must select a specific model.

### Provider

An AI service that powers conversations. Claude (via Agent SDK + Max subscription) is the primary provider. The architecture supports additional providers (API key, Bedrock, Vertex, alternative models) through the composable sidecar interface, without changing the Rust core or Svelte UI.

### ProviderEvent

The provider-agnostic event protocol that the Rust core understands. All sidecar providers translate their native events into ProviderEvents. Types include: StreamStart, TextDelta, ToolCall, ToolResult, StreamEnd, Error, Usage.

### Agent SDK

The current default AI provider integration. In the current implementation, OrqaStudio uses a sidecar built on the Anthropic Agent SDK as the default provider, which spawns the Claude Code CLI as a subprocess. This sidecar supports features such as disabling built-in tools, tool approval callbacks, token-level streaming, and custom MCP server configuration. The architecture is provider-agnostic — future providers connect through the same sidecar interface without changing the Rust core.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

A protocol for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources. OrqaStudio exposes its own tools as a custom MCP server to the Agent SDK. OrqaStudio also acts as an MCP host, allowing users to connect additional MCP servers for extensibility.

### Channel\<T\>

Tauri's streaming mechanism for sending data from the Rust backend to the Svelte frontend. Used for streaming conversation tokens. Complements `invoke()` (used for CRUD operations) and events (used for notifications).

### IPC Boundary

The Tauri command interface — the only communication channel between the Rust backend and Svelte frontend. All commands are defined as `#[tauri::command]` functions. No HTTP servers, no WebSocket servers, no shared memory.

### NDJSON

Newline-Delimited JSON — the wire format for sidecar ↔ Rust communication over stdin/stdout. Each line is a complete JSON object. Same pattern as LSP. Sub-millisecond latency with no port management.

---

## Persistence Concepts

### Hybrid File/DB Model

The persistence strategy where governance artifacts are stored as files on disk (authoritative, git-committed) and indexed in SQLite (derived cache for search and metadata). File changes are detected by a file watcher and trigger re-indexing.

### FTS5

SQLite's full-text search extension. OrqaStudio uses two FTS5 virtual tables: one for session message search, one for governance artifact search. Provides sub-50ms search across all content.

### Handoff Notes

Session continuity data that summarizes what happened in a session and what the next session should know. Enables context transfer across sessions.

---

## UI Concepts

### Panel

A resizable section of the OrqaStudio window. PaneForge manages three resizable zones: the Nav Sub-Panel (per-category sub-navigation), the Explorer Panel (artifact viewer/editor, dashboards, settings), and the Chat Panel (conversation). The Activity Bar (48px fixed icon rail) sits outside PaneForge and controls what both the Nav Sub-Panel and Explorer Panel display.

### Project Dashboard

A dedicated Explorer Panel view showing project overview information: detected stack, project root path, governance artifact counts (agents, rules, skills, hooks), quick links to scanner status, metrics, and learning, and recent sessions with quick-resume links. Accessed via the top icon in the Activity Bar (`Ctrl+0`). When active, the Nav Sub-Panel is hidden.

### Activity Bar

A fixed 48px vertical icon rail on the far left of the window. The top icon is Project Dashboard (`Ctrl+0`). Below it are artifact categories (Docs, Agents, Rules, Skills, Hooks), then dashboards (Scanners, Metrics, Learning), and Settings at the bottom. Clicking an icon switches the Explorer Panel and Nav Sub-Panel to the corresponding view. The Activity Bar is always visible and not collapsible.

### Explorer Panel

The central content area that displays artifacts, dashboards, or settings based on the active Activity Bar icon. When an artifact category is active and an artifact is selected in the Nav Sub-Panel, shows the artifact's viewer/editor. If no artifact is selected (or the Nav Sub-Panel is collapsed), shows the artifact list as a fallback. When a dashboard icon is active, shows that dashboard. The Explorer Panel is always visible and never collapses — it is the focal point of the artifact-centric layout.

### Nav Sub-Panel

A collapsible 200px panel between the Activity Bar and Explorer Panel. Provides per-category sub-navigation: a structured doc tree for the Docs category, flat/categorized lists for Agents, Rules, Skills, and Hooks. Hidden when Project Dashboard, Scanners, or Metrics is active. Toggle with `Ctrl+B`. Collapse range: 200px default, 160px minimum, 280px maximum, collapses to 0px.

### Session Dropdown

A dropdown control in the Chat Panel header for switching between sessions. Shows the active session title (clickable to open), a list of recent sessions with search filter, and a "New Session" button. Replaces the dedicated Sessions Panel from the previous four-zone layout [AD-018](AD-018). `Ctrl+N` creates a new session directly.

### Chat Panel

The rightmost zone, always visible. Shows the active conversation session — message stream, streaming tokens, tool call cards, and message input. The conversation stays visible while browsing artifacts in the Explorer Panel, enabling side-by-side collaboration.

### Artifact Browser

The combined Nav Sub-Panel + Explorer Panel view for browsing governance artifacts. The active category is determined by the Activity Bar icon (Docs, Agents, Rules, Skills, or Hooks). The Nav Sub-Panel shows the artifact list or tree navigation; the Explorer Panel renders the selected artifact's markdown content in the viewer and provides source editing via CodeMirror 6.

### Streaming Display

The real-time rendering of AI response tokens as they arrive. Tokens flow through the pipeline: Agent SDK → sidecar → NDJSON → Rust → Channel\<T\> → Svelte `$state` → DOM update. Each token triggers a fine-grained reactive update.

### Tool Call Card

A UI component that displays a tool invocation within a conversation: the tool name, input parameters, and result. Tool call cards are collapsible and will support approval/denial flows in a future build.

### Feature Gate

A row in the SQLite `feature_gates` table that controls whether a feature is visible to the user. Used for progressive disclosure — features appear as they become relevant, avoiding upfront complexity.

## Roles

### Product Manager (PM)

A human user who defines product requirements, reviews implementation plans, and manages the governance framework. The primary persona for OrqaStudio. May also fill the Tech Lead role.

### Tech Lead

A human user who approves implementation plans, reviews architecture decisions, and has final authority on technical approach. May also fill the PM role. Implementation plans require Tech Lead approval before coding begins.

### Developer

A human user who uses OrqaStudio for structured, repeatable AI-assisted development. The secondary persona — benefits from governance visibility but may not define the governance framework themselves.

### Orchestrator

The coordinating intelligence in the agentic team. In the bootstrap phase, this is the main Claude Code CLI session operating through `.claude/` symlinks to `.orqa/` artifacts. In OrqaStudio, this becomes the Rust backend + sidecar system using any supported AI provider. The orchestrator delegates implementation to agents and gates completion on review.
