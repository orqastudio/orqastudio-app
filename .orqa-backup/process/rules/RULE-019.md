## The Rule

**If a deliverable is listed in an epic's scope (roadmap items, task list, or plan), it ships with that epic. No exceptions.**

Deferring a scoped deliverable to a future epic is forbidden. It creates invisible gaps — the epic is marked "done" but the user's expectation (based on the roadmap) is unmet. This is a form of dishonest reporting.

## What Counts as a Deliverable

A deliverable is any item that appears in:

- The epic's roadmap entry (e.g., D1 items in `.orqa/documentation/about/roadmap.md`)
- The epic's task list in `.orqa/delivery/epics/EPIC-NNN.md`
- The epic's implementation design (in the epic body)
- The epic's `docs-produced` list

If it's listed, it's in scope. If it's in scope, it ships.

## Before Planning Begins

During planning, the orchestrator MUST reconcile the epic's scope with the roadmap entry:

1. Read the roadmap entry for the epic (e.g., D1 items under Milestone 1)
2. Ensure every roadmap item appears as a task in the plan
3. If an item genuinely cannot be completed without another epic's work being done first, **flag it to the user** before planning is approved — not after implementation starts
4. The user decides whether to: (a) include the prerequisite work in this epic, (b) explicitly remove the item from this epic's roadmap scope, or (c) restructure the epics

## During Implementation

- If an agent discovers a deliverable is harder than expected, the orchestrator reports this to the user and asks for direction — NOT silently defers it
- "Will be wired up in EPIC-NNN" is FORBIDDEN in completion reports
- "Deferred to EPIC-NNN" is FORBIDDEN unless the user explicitly approved the deferral during planning

## The Completion Check

Before marking an epic as done, the orchestrator MUST:

1. Re-read the epic's roadmap entry
2. Verify every listed item has been implemented (not just planned, not just typed — implemented and verified)
3. If any item is missing, the epic is NOT done

## Cross-Epic Dependencies

Sometimes a deliverable genuinely depends on infrastructure from another epic. This is handled at planning time, not implementation time:

| Situation | Resolution |
|-----------|------------|
| Item depends on another epic's infrastructure | Include the minimum infrastructure in THIS epic, or get user approval to remove the item from scope |
| Item is trivially blocked | Build the prerequisite as part of this epic |
| Item requires a large body of work from another domain | Flag to user: "This item requires X, which is EPIC-NNN scope. Should I include it here or remove it from this epic's deliverables?" |

**The key principle:** The user should never be surprised that a deliverable was skipped. Every scope reduction is a user decision, not an agent decision.

## Scope Decisions Are Human Decisions (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**AI agents MUST NEVER decide what is or is not in scope.** Agents can and should advise on scope — flagging items that seem too large, identifying dependencies, recommending scope changes — but the decision to include, exclude, or defer a deliverable is always made by the user.

This applies at every stage:

- **Planning**: Agents propose scope; the user approves it
- **Implementation**: If an agent discovers something should be descoped, it stops and asks — it does not unilaterally remove it
- **Completion**: Agents surface all outstanding items for user guidance — they do not classify items as "not blocking" or "minor" and move on

### No Assumptions — Ask, Don't Guess

When an agent encounters ambiguity about scope, priority, or approach:

- **If the ambiguity does not block current work**: continue with other tasks, collect the questions, and ask them all at the next natural checkpoint or at completion
- **If the ambiguity blocks the current task**: stop immediately and ask before proceeding
- **Never guess and continue** — a wrong assumption creates more work than a brief pause to clarify

### The "Not Blocking" Anti-Pattern

Framing outstanding work as "none of these are blocking" or "these are minor cleanup items" is a way of dismissing work without user input. It signals "I don't think this matters" — but that judgement is not the agent's to make.

**When work remains at assumed completion:**

1. **Tend towards doing it anyway** — if the items are small and clearly within scope, complete them rather than listing them as deferred
2. **If genuinely uncertain**, surface every outstanding item explicitly to the user with enough context for them to decide: do it now, track it, or descope it
3. **Never batch outstanding items into a dismissive summary** like "a few minor cleanup items remain" — enumerate them individually

**FORBIDDEN language in completion reports:**

- "None of these are blocking" — the user decides what blocks
- "Minor cleanup remaining" — the user decides what's minor
- "Out of scope for this epic" — the user decides scope
- "Can be done in a future session" — the user decides timing
- "Low priority items" — the user decides priority

## FORBIDDEN Patterns

```text
## Out of Scope (handled by other epics)
- `ContextInjected` emission — depends on EPIC-003
```
^ This is the orchestrator unilaterally removing a deliverable without user approval.

```text
## What Is NOT Done
- custom_prompt is always None — EPIC-002 will populate this
```
^ This is deferring a deliverable. If custom_prompt is in scope, implement it. If it's genuinely out of scope, the user must have approved its removal.

```text
## Remaining Items
- 322 bare-ID warnings — not blocking
- 8 stale docs — minor cleanup
- 5 skill renames — deferred due to complexity
```
^ This is the agent triaging outstanding work without user input. Each item must be surfaced individually for the user to decide.
