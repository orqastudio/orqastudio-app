When agents write to specific code areas, the enforcement engine automatically injects
relevant domain skills as system context. This implements Layer 2 (Knowledge Injection)
of the structured thinking enforcement system.

## How It Works

Enforcement entries with `action: inject` and a `skills` array are evaluated on every
Write/Edit tool call. When a file path matches, the specified skills are read from
`.orqa/process/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` and returned as `systemMessage` to inject into the
agent's context.

## Path-to-Skill Map

| File Path Pattern | Injected Skills | Why |
|------------------|-----------------|-----|
| `backend/src-tauri/src/domain/**` | `orqa-domain-services`, `orqa-error-composition` | Domain logic needs service anatomy and error flow |
| `backend/src-tauri/src/commands/**` | `orqa-ipc-patterns`, `orqa-error-composition` | IPC boundary needs contract discipline |
| `backend/src-tauri/src/repo/**` | `orqa-repository-pattern` | Data access has specific patterns |
| `sidecar/src/**` | `orqa-streaming` | Sidecar protocol is fragile |
| `ui/src/lib/components/**` | `component-extraction`, `svelte5-best-practices` | Components need purity discipline |
| `ui/src/lib/stores/**` | `orqa-store-patterns`, `orqa-store-orchestration` | Reactive state needs specific patterns |
| `.orqa/**` | `orqa-governance`, `orqa-documentation` | Artifacts need structural consistency |

## Deduplication

Skills are injected once per session. If an agent writes to `backend/src-tauri/src/domain/foo.rs`
and then `backend/src-tauri/src/domain/bar.rs`, the domain skills are only injected on the first
write. The enforcement engine tracks injected skills per session and skips re-injection.

## Adding New Injection Mappings

To add a new path-to-skill mapping:

1. Add an enforcement entry to this rule's frontmatter
2. Set `event: file`, `action: inject`
3. Set `paths` to the glob patterns
4. Set `skills` to the skill directory names
5. Set `message` to a brief description

Ensure the referenced skills exist in `.orqa/process/skills/`.

## FORBIDDEN

- Injection entries that block tool calls (inject is always non-blocking)
- Injection entries without a `skills` field
- Referencing skills that don't exist in `.orqa/process/skills/`
