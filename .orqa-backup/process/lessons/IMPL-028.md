title: "AI provider requirements are bidirectional — providers need plugins too"
description: "Plugin-to-provider is only half the relationship. When a user selects an AI provider, the system should know which plugins are required to enable that provider to work correctly. This means AI providers themselves need a schema that declares their plugin requirements. The relationship is bidirectional: plugins declare which providers they support, providers declare which plugins they need."

## Pattern

The plugin-provider relationship was initially framed as one-directional: plugins declare `requires.ai-providers` to say which providers they work with. But the inverse is equally important:

When a user selects "Claude Code CLI" as their AI provider, the system should:
1. Know which plugins are required for that provider to function (e.g., `orqastudio-claude-plugin`)
2. Check if those plugins are installed
3. Prompt the user to install missing required plugins
4. Surface which optional plugins enhance the provider experience

This means AI providers are themselves first-class configuration objects with a schema — not just strings in a plugin's `requires` array.

An AI provider schema might declare:
- Identity (name, display label, version)
- Required plugins (must be installed for the provider to work)
- Optional plugins (enhance the experience)
- Detection mechanism (how the system knows this provider is active)
- Capability profile (what tools/features this provider supports — feeds into [RULE-040](RULE-040) capability resolution)

## Fix

Design an AI provider schema as app-native config in `.orqa/providers/<name>.json` (one file per provider). Provider definitions are NOT plugins — they are native to the app. This keeps them separate from plugins for now, while the file-per-provider pattern makes future convergence into plugins natural (see IDEA-069).

The provider schema declares: identity, display name, detection mechanism, capabilities profile, required plugins, and optional plugins. This creates the bidirectional relationship: providers know what plugins they need, plugins know what providers they support.
