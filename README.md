# OrqaStudio

> **OrqaStudio™ is an AI-assisted clarity engine that helps people turn messy situations into structured understanding and evolving plans through agile thinking and continuous retrospection.**

Rather than focusing primarily on building software or managing tasks, OrqaStudio focuses on **improving the quality of thinking that precedes action**. Projects, backlogs, and execution plans are outputs of improved understanding, not the primary goal.

---

## What OrqaStudio Does

- **AI-assisted thinking** — Use AI as a structured reasoning partner to explore problems, challenge assumptions, and build understanding before committing to action
- **Artifact-driven knowledge** — Conversations produce markdown artifacts — plans, decisions, retrospectives — that evolve over time and accumulate into a knowledge base
- **Reflective learning** — Every session feeds the learning loop. Mistakes become lessons, lessons become rules, rules become enforcement. The system gets smarter with each cycle.
- **Governance as a living system** — Standards, rules, and agent definitions are visible, enforceable, and editable through the UI — not hidden in dotfiles
- **Domain-agnostic core** — Software development is the first domain, but the clarity engine applies to any complex work: research, operations, consulting, personal management

### Core Principles

- **Clarity before execution** — Clear thinking leads to better action
- **Human-led AI** — AI acts as a structured thinking partner rather than replacing human judgement
- **Agile as a thinking system** — Restoring the full agile learning loop, not just backlog management
- **Artifact-driven reasoning** — Markdown artifacts are the canonical state of knowledge, reusable in prompts and portable outside the system

### The Agile Learning Loop

```
Chaos / Input
  --> Structured Understanding
  --> Experiments / Backlog
  --> Execution
  --> Retrospective
  --> Improved Understanding
```

### Entry Modes

Users can enter from four starting points — each supporting new projects or existing work:

| Mode | Starting point |
|------|---------------|
| **Problem** | Something is not working and needs diagnosis |
| **Idea** | A concept needs validation and shaping |
| **Goal** | A desired outcome requires planning |
| **Chaos** | A messy situation needs clarity |

Each path triggers different AI-assisted onboarding flows but converges into the same structured reasoning loop.
