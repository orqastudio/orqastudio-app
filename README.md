# OrqaStudio

OrqaStudio is an AI-assisted clarity engine that helps people turn complex situations into structured understanding and evolving plans.

It applies agile thinking beyond software development, enabling individuals and teams to explore problems, design experiments, and continuously learn through structured retrospection.

---

## Project Philosophy

OrqaStudio focuses on **clarity before execution**. Clear thinking leads to better action.

The platform supports a structured thinking loop:

```
Chaos --> Clarity --> Structured Understanding --> Experiments --> Reflection --> Improved Understanding
```

### Core Principles

- **Clarity before execution** — Clear thinking leads to better action
- **Human-led AI** — AI acts as a structured thinking partner rather than replacing human judgement
- **Artifact-driven reasoning** — Markdown artifacts represent structured knowledge that can evolve over time
- **Reflective learning** — Retrospectives and iteration history enable continuous learning

## What OrqaStudio Does

- **Wraps Claude Code** — Same model, same capabilities, but with a UI that surfaces the process layer
- **Backfills governance** — Point it at an existing codebase, answer questions, and OrqaStudio progressively builds the documentation, rules, and agent definitions through conversation
- **Makes process visible** — Scanner dashboards, task pipelines, retrospective cards, and metrics charts replace terminal output
- **Persists everything** — Conversation history linked to artifacts, searchable across sessions
