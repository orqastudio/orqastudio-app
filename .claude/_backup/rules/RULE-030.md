User acceptance testing follows a structured process that prevents premature fixing and ensures systemic solutions.

## UAT Phases (MANDATORY)

See the `uat-process` skill for full phase methodology.

### Phase 1: Collection — Listen and record findings without fixing or diagnosing.

### Phase 2: Systemic Analysis — Group findings by root cause and investigate architecture before proposing solutions.

### Phase 3: Task Creation — Create tasks scoped to systemic themes, not individual findings.

### Phase 4: Fix and Verify — Implement fixes, re-test, and encode process improvements.

## Process Improvement Encoding (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every UAT round produces process learnings alongside bug findings. These MUST be encoded:

1. **Lessons** — create IMPL-NNN for each process insight discovered
2. **Rule/skill updates** — if a process worked well, encode it in the relevant governance artifact
3. **Audit trail** — the chain from finding → lesson → enforcement artifact must be traceable

A UAT round that only produces bug fixes without process improvements has failed to exercise Pillar 2 (Learning Through Reflection).

## FORBIDDEN

- Fixing findings one by one as they are reported (breaks systemic analysis)
- Creating tasks before grouping findings by root cause
- Skipping the architectural investigation step
- Completing a UAT epic without encoding process improvements as lessons
- Treating UAT as "just testing" — it is testing AND learning
