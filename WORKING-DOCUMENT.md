## The Foundation

Everything is a node on a graph. Nodes connect through typed relationships. The graph IS the thinking made visible. That's the product.

## Core Types (Universal, Always Exist)

These represent universal concepts in structured thinking. Every project has them regardless of domain.

| Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Pillars | What we believe — guiding principles |
| Vision | Where we're going |
| Personas | Who we serve |
| Grounding | What anchors agent behavior |
| Ideas | Entry point for any change — to the project, process, or principles |
| Decisions | Resolutions that direct work and authorise enforcement |
| Rules | Standards we enforce |
| Lessons | What we've learned |
| Skills | Knowledge we teach |
| Agents | Roles that do work |

**Ideas** are the universal entry point. Where an idea goes depends on what it is — it might evolve into delivery work, or drive a decision that governs a rule. The idea is always preserved as the record of original thinking.

**Decisions** are the bridge. They appear in multiple views because they serve multiple roles.

Labels and icons on core types are configurable per project for contextual clarity. A consulting project might call "Rules" → "Standards" and "Lessons" → "Insights." The canonical type key stays the same.

## Project Types (Configurable)

Everything beyond the core is project-specific:

**Discovery types** — ways of informing ideas and decisions. Software: research, wireframes. Consulting: client discovery, stakeholder maps. Research: literature review, experiments.

**Delivery types** — ways of acting on ideas and decisions. Software: milestones, epics, tasks. Consulting: phases, workstreams, deliverables. Personal: goals, actions.

Labels, icons, hierarchy depth, and status aliases are all project-configurable. A research project might use a flask icon for experiments and a microscope for observations.

## Relationship Vocabulary

Relationships are the ONLY way artifacts connect. Each has a clear semantic:

| Relationship | Inverse | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `informs` | `informed-by` | Supplementary context | Research informs an idea |
| `evolves-into` | `evolves-from` | Thinking becomes action | Idea evolves into an epic |
| `drives` | `driven-by` | Decision directs work | Decision drives an epic's design |
| `governs` | `governed-by` | Decision authorises enforcement | Decision governs a rule |
| `delivers` | `delivered-by` | Work contributes to a goal | Task delivers to an epic |
| `enforces` | `enforced-by` | Mechanical enforcement | Rule enforces a standard |
| `grounded` | `grounded-by` | Foundational anchor | Agent grounded by a pillar |
| `observes` | `observed-by` | Learning captured | Lesson observes a pattern |
| `merged-into` | `merged-from` | Ideas converged | Idea merged into a new idea |

No standalone frontmatter fields for connections. No `epic: EPIC-045`. Only relationships.

### Relationship types to review

Existing types NOT in the vocabulary above that need decisions:

| Current Type | Keep / Rename / Remove | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `scoped-to` / `scoped-by` | Review | Was for rule→agent scope. Still needed? |
| `contains` / `belongs-to` | Review | Was for epic→task containment. Replaced by `delivers`? |
| `documents` / `documented-by` | Review | Docs↔rules linkage. Still needed or covered by `informs`? |
| `practices` / `practiced-by` | Review | Skill→agent linkage. Still needed? |
| `verifies` / `verified-by` | Review | Review gate linkage. Still needed? |
| `synchronised-with` | New | Docs↔skills synchronisation |

### Standalone fields to migrate

All of these become relationships:

| Field | On Type | Becomes Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `epic` | Tasks | `delivers → EPIC-NNN` |
| `milestone` | Epics | `belongs-to → MS-NNN` (or `delivers`) |
| `depends-on` | Tasks | New relationship type (e.g., `blocked-by`) |
| `promoted-to` | Ideas/Lessons | `evolves-into → RULE-NNN` |
| `surpassed-by` | Research | `surpassed-by` relationship |
| `supersedes` / `superseded-by` | Decisions | Relationship |
| `pillars` | Ideas/Epics | `grounded-by → PILLAR-NNN` (already migrated) |
| `research-refs` | Epics | `informed-by → RES-NNN` |
| `docs-required` / `docs-produced` | Epics | Relationships to doc artifacts |

## How Ideas Evolve

An idea doesn't "promote" — it **evolves**. And it can evolve in multiple directions:

1. Idea → `evolves-into` → delivery artifact (epic, task, experiment)
2. Idea → `evolves-into` → decision → `governs` → rule
3. Idea → `evolves-into` → decision → `drives` → delivery artifact
4. Idea → status moves to `completed` (the thinking is done, the output is connected)

Research and other discovery types `inform` ideas and decisions. They're supplementary input, not the driver.

## Sections Are Graph Filters

The nav sections don't categorise artifacts. They filter the graph by relationship patterns. An artifact appears in every section its relationships qualify it for.

| Section | Shows | Label for Decisions |
|---|---|---|
| **Principles** | Pillars, Vision, Personas, Grounding | — |
| **Discovery** | Ideas, Decisions, project discovery types | "Decisions" (all) |
| **Learning** | Rules, Lessons, Skills, Agents, + decisions with `governs` edges | "Governing Decisions" |
| **Delivery** | Project delivery types + decisions with `drives` edges | "Driving Decisions" |

Decisions appear in Discovery (where they're made), Learning (when they govern rules), and Delivery (when they drive work). The contextual label explains WHY the decision appears in each section.

## State Machine

Status is a property of each node. Transitions are graph queries.

**Universal statuses**: captured → exploring → ready → prioritised → active → hold → blocked → review → completed → surpassed → recurring

Projects can define **label aliases** for display (key stays canonical). Icons are configurable per status.

**Auto-rules are graph queries:**
```json
{
  "condition": "all-related-in-status",
  "relationship": "delivers",
  "status": "completed",
  "target": "review"
}
```

"When all nodes connected via `delivers` relationships are in `completed` status → propose transitioning this node to `review`."

The state machine isn't a separate system — it's rules about which transitions are valid given the current graph state.

## Views Are Graph Queries

| View | What it renders |
|---|---|
| **Roadmap** | Graph filtered to delivery types, grouped by hierarchy, status as columns |
| **Dashboard** | Aggregate queries: health, status distribution, attention needed, trends |
| **Scratchpad** | Ideas and discovery types on a spatial canvas — each item IS a graph node |
| **Artifact viewer** | Single node with its relationships |
| **Full graph** | Everything |

## Enforcement

The process is enforced by app code, not AI instructions. Invalid graph states are mechanically impossible.

| Constraint | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Delivery artifact must connect to parent | App rejects creation without relationship |
| Status transition must be in valid list | App won't allow invalid transitions |
| Child can't be further along than parent | App flags immediately, blocks until resolved |
| Relationships must be bidirectional | App creates inverse automatically |
| Statuses must be from configured vocabulary | App rejects invalid values |

This is not behavioral guidance for AI. This is the app refusing to accept invalid state — like a database rejecting bad SQL. If enforcement depends on AI remembering rules, enforcement fails under pressure (proven this session).

### Three Enforcement Layers

| Layer | When | What it does | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **App enforcement** | At action time | Prevents invalid states mechanically | Can't save invalid status transition |
| **Integrity checks** | On scan/refresh | Flags problems that need human judgment | "Child further along than parent — advance parent or move child?" |
| **Git hooks** | At commit time | Safety net for edits that bypassed the app | Text editor changes, CLI agent edits |

**App enforcement** makes invalid states impossible. You can't create them.

**Integrity checks** detect states that are technically valid but semantically wrong — situations where code can identify the problem but only a human can decide the fix. Examples:
- Body text references an artifact with no corresponding relationship
- Lesson has recurred 3 times (promote to rule?)
- All tasks completed on an epic (move to review?)
- Child artifact further along than parent (advance parent or move child?)

**Git hooks** are the last line of defence for when changes happen outside the app — text editors, CLI agents, manual file editing. They run the same integrity checks at commit time.

### Fourth Layer: Automated Scanners

A fourth enforcement layer that sits between app enforcement and integrity checks:

**Automated scanners** run on file watcher events. When an artifact changes on disk, the scanner:
1. Reads the changed file's relationships
2. Evaluates connected nodes for objective state changes
3. Auto-applies transitions that are unambiguous (no human judgment needed)

Examples:
- All tasks on an epic are `completed` → scanner auto-moves epic to `review`
- A dependency completes → scanner auto-unblocks the waiting task
- A lesson hits recurrence threshold → scanner auto-moves to `review`

These are the configurable auto_rules from the state machine, triggered by file watcher events rather than manual scans. The file watcher detects the change, the scanner evaluates the graph query, and the transition happens automatically.

| Layer | When | Human needed? |
|---|---|---|
| **App enforcement** | At action time | No — invalid states impossible |
| **Automated scanners** | On file change (watcher) | No — objective transitions auto-applied |
| **Integrity checks** | On scan/refresh | Yes — flags judgment-required issues |
| **Git hooks** | At commit time | Yes — last line of defence |

### Idea Merging

Ideas should be mergeable. When multiple ideas converge into one concept:
1. A new idea is created
2. The source ideas connect to the new idea via `merged-into` / `merged-from` relationships
3. Source ideas move to `surpassed` status (thinking evolved, originals preserved)
4. The new idea inherits context through the relationships — the full provenance chain is visible

This preserves change history. You can always trace back to the original ideas that led to the merged concept.

AI rules/skills become documentation: they teach agents HOW to work with the system, not how to ENFORCE it. The app enforces. The agent operates within the enforced boundaries.

## Documentation and Skills Are Separate But Synchronised

Documentation and skills are different artifacts written for different audiences:

| | Documentation | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| **Audience** | Humans | Agents |
| **Tone** | Narrative, explanatory | Concise, actionable |
| **Structure** | Chapters, sections, examples | Rules, patterns, do/don't |
| **Format** | Long-form readable | Context-window efficient |

They cover the same knowledge but are authored differently. You can't make one markdown file serve both audiences well.

**Synchronisation through relationships:** A skill and its corresponding documentation page are connected via a relationship (e.g., `synchronised-with`). The integrity checker flags when one is modified without the other — preventing the drift we've been fighting.

The graph ensures they stay aligned. When documentation changes, the connected skill is flagged for review. When a skill is updated, its documentation is flagged too.

**But skills are broader than documentation.** Not every skill has a corresponding doc page. Skills fall into three categories:

| Category | Example | Synchronised with docs? |
|---|---|---|
| **Project skills** | "How our artifact statuses work" | Yes — same knowledge, two renderings |
| **Domain skills** | Rust patterns, Svelte 5, testing methodology | No — portable expertise, not project-specific |
| **Platform skills** | How OrqaStudio works | No — shipped with the app, uneditable |

**Documentation has two categories too:**

| Category | Example | Editable? |
|---|---|---|
| **Platform documentation** | How to use OrqaStudio, how statuses work, what the roadmap shows | No — shipped with app |
| **Project documentation** | Architecture docs, how-to guides, specifications | Yes — project-specific |

The symmetry:
- Platform docs ↔ Platform skills (same knowledge, human vs agent, app-shipped)
- Project docs ↔ Project skills (same knowledge, human vs agent, synchronised)
- Domain skills have no doc counterpart (portable expertise, not project or platform)

## Open Questions (Unresolved)

1. **Existing relationship types** — scoped-to, contains, documents, practices, verifies are in use but not in the new vocabulary. For each: keep, rename, or absorb? Is `contains/belongs-to` the same as `delivers/delivered-by` or semantically different (containment vs contribution)?

2. **`surpassed` doing double duty** — it's a status (overtaken by newer work) AND used for idea merging (source ideas surpassed). Should merged ideas use `archived` instead, or is surpassed correct for both?

3. **Status restriction per type** — one vocabulary with aliases, but do ALL 11 statuses make sense for every type? Does a task need `exploring`? Does a milestone need `recurring`? Should config allow restricting which statuses apply to which type?

4. **`depends-on` replacement** — what relationship type? `blocked-by`? Or keep `depends-on/depended-on-by` as its own type since dependency is structural (always exists) while blocking is a state (temporary)?

5. **Research as core vs project** — we concluded research is project-specific, but `.orqa/delivery/research/` is heavily used with 60+ files. Migrate now or later?

6. **Agent skills during migration** — governance is disconnected but agents need implementation quality guidance. Which skills load manually? Coding standards, composability, Svelte 5, Tauri v2, Rust patterns at minimum.

## Key Design Principles

1. **The graph is the only data structure.** No standalone fields, no side channels.
2. **Sections are views, not categories.** The graph doesn't have sections. Views filter by relationship patterns.
3. **Core types are universal thinking concepts.** They exist in every project, every domain.
4. **Project types are configurable.** Discovery and delivery types adapt to the domain.
5. **The app enforces structure.** State machine rules, graph integrity, and status transitions are app-level enforcement, not AI rules.
6. **AI knows the system through app-shipped docs.** Uneditable conventions, loaded into agent context.
7. **Project rules are project-specific.** Editable by the project, enforce project standards.

## Reconnection Instructions

To restore the full governance system after this holistic discussion:

1. **Restore CLAUDE.md, rules, agents, skills:**

   ```bash
   cp .claude/_backup/CLAUDE.md.bak .claude/CLAUDE.md
   mv .claude/_backup/rules .claude/rules
   mv .claude/_backup/agents .claude/agents
   mv .claude/_backup/skills .claude/skills
   rmdir .claude/_backup
   ```

2. **Or just start a new session:**
   The orqastudio-claude-plugin's `session-start.sh` hook recreates these
   from `.orqa/` source of truth on every session start. The `_backup`
   directory can then be deleted.

3. **Clean up:**

   ```bash
   rm WORKING-DOCUMENT.md  # Delete this file when discussion is complete
   ```
