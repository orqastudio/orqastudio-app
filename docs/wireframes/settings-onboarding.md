# Wireframe: Settings & Onboarding

**Date:** 2026-03-02 | **Informed by:** [Onboarding Research](/research/onboarding), [MVP Spec F-001, F-001b, F-009](/product/mvp-specification)

Settings appears in the Explorer Panel when the user clicks the Settings icon in the Activity Bar (bottom) or presses `Ctrl+,`. Onboarding flows are full-window overlays shown on first run or when no project is loaded.

## 1. Settings in Explorer Panel (All Sections)

```plantuml

      ---
      {#
        Shortcut | Action
        Ctrl+K | Global search
        Ctrl+N | New session
        Ctrl+B | Toggle Nav Sub-Panel
        Ctrl+, | Open settings

      }
    }
    ---
    .
  }
}
@endsalt
```

### Settings Section Behavior

| Section | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Provider** | CLI path can be typed, browsed via native file dialog, or auto-detected. Auto-detect searches PATH and common install locations. Sidecar status updates in real time. |
| **Project** | Project root is read-only in normal use; "Change..." opens the project switcher. Rescan re-indexes all files and updates the stack detection. |
| **Appearance** | Theme dropdown offers Light, Dark, System. Font size dropdown ranges 12px--20px. Panel widths accept numeric input with min/max validation. |
| **Keyboard Shortcuts** | Read-only reference card. All shortcuts are global (not remappable in MVP). |

---

## 2. First-Run Welcome Screen (No Project, No API Key)

Full-window overlay. No panels -- just the centered welcome content.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{+
  {/ <b>Forge</b> | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
  {+
    {
      . | . | . | . | . | .
      ---
      .
      .
      { . | . | <b><size:24>Forge</size></b> | . | . }
      { . | . | <i>AI-powered product management</i> | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | . | Welcome to Forge. Let's get you set up. | . | . }
      .
      { . | . | To start, Forge needs access to Claude Code | . | . }
      { . | . | CLI so it can run AI sessions on your behalf. | . | . }
      .
      ---
      .
      { . | . | [Set Up Claude Code CLI ->] | . | . }
      .
      ---
      .
      .
    }
  }
  { . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
}
@endsalt
```

### Welcome Screen Behavior

| Element | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Anvil mark** | Rendered above the title in the actual UI; Salt cannot depict graphical logos. |
| **Set Up Claude Code CLI** | Primary action button, advances to the CLI setup step (State 3). |
| **No wizard steps** | There is no numbered step indicator. Progression is linear but presented as self-contained screens, consistent with conversation-first progressive disclosure. |

---

## 3. API Key / CLI Setup Step

Still a full-window overlay. The user provides the Claude Code CLI path.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{+
  {/ <b>Forge</b> | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
  {+
    {
      . | . | . | . | . | .
      ---
      .
      { . | <b><size:18>Connect Claude Code CLI</size></b> | . | . }
      .
      { . | Forge uses the Claude Code CLI as its AI engine. | . | . }
      { . | Enter the path or let Forge find it automatically. | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | CLI Path | . | . }
      { . | [                                ] | [Browse...] | . }
      .
      { . | [Auto-detect] | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | <b>Status:</b> | . | . }
      { . | <&circle-x> <color:red>Not configured</color> | . | . }
      .
      ---
      .
      { . | [<- Back] | . | [Continue ->] | . }
      .
    }
  }
  { . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
}
@endsalt
```

### CLI Setup -- After Successful Detection

```plantuml
@startsalt
{+
  {/ <b>Forge</b> | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
  {+
    {
      . | . | . | . | . | .
      ---
      .
      { . | <b><size:18>Connect Claude Code CLI</size></b> | . | . }
      .
      { . | Forge uses the Claude Code CLI as its AI engine. | . | . }
      { . | Enter the path or let Forge find it automatically. | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | CLI Path | . | . }
      { . | [/usr/local/bin/claude           ] | [Browse...] | . }
      .
      { . | [Auto-detect] | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | <b>Status:</b> | . | . }
      { . | <&circle-check> <color:green>Found Claude Code v1.2 -- Max subscription active</color> | . | . }
      .
      ---
      .
      { . | [<- Back] | . | [Continue ->] | . }
      .
    }
  }
  { . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
}
@endsalt
```

### CLI Setup States

| State | Status Indicator | Continue Button |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Not configured | <span style="color:red">Red X</span> -- "Not configured" | Disabled |
| Detecting... | Spinner -- "Searching..." | Disabled |
| Found | <span style="color:green">Green check</span> -- version and subscription info | Enabled |
| Error | <span style="color:red">Red X</span> -- "Not found at path" or "CLI returned error" | Disabled |

---

## 4. Project Open with Scan Results

After CLI setup, the user selects a project folder. This screen shows the scan results and invites the user into the main workspace.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{+
  {/ <b>Forge</b> | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
  {+
    {
      . | . | . | . | . | .
      ---
      .
      { . | <b><size:18>Project Scanned</size></b> | . | . }
      .
      { . | <b>forge</b> -- ~/code/forge | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . |
        {#
          Category | Detected
          Languages | Rust, TypeScript, Svelte
          Frameworks | Tauri v2, shadcn-svelte
          Build Tools | Cargo, Vite
          VCS | Git (clean)
          Files | 1,247 tracked
        }
      | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | Governance artifacts (.claude/ directory): | . | . }
      { . | <&circle-check> 3 Agents, 5 Rules, 2 Skills, 1 Hook | . | . }
      .
      ---
      .
      { . | [<- Change Project] | . | [Open Workspace ->] | . }
      .
    }
  }
  { . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
}
@endsalt
```

### Project Selection -- Preceding Step

Before the scan results appear, the user sees a project selection screen.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{+
  {/ <b>Forge</b> | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
  {+
    {
      . | . | . | . | . | .
      ---
      .
      { . | <b><size:18>Open a Project</size></b> | . | . }
      .
      { . | Select a folder to manage with Forge. | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | [Open Folder...] | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | <b>Recent Projects</b> | . | . }
      { . | <i>(No recent projects)</i> | . | . }
      .
      ---
      .
      { . | [<- Back] | . | . }
      .
    }
  }
  { . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
}
@endsalt
```

### Project Selection -- With Recent Projects (Return Visit)

```plantuml
@startsalt
{+
  {/ <b>Forge</b> | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
  {+
    {
      . | . | . | . | . | .
      ---
      .
      { . | <b><size:18>Open a Project</size></b> | . | . }
      .
      { . | Select a folder to manage with Forge. | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | [Open Folder...] | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | <b>Recent Projects</b> | . | . }
      {SI
        {
          <&folder> <b>forge</b>
          ~/code/forge -- Rust, TypeScript, Svelte
        }
        ---
        {
          <&folder> <b>acme-api</b>
          ~/code/acme-api -- Go, PostgreSQL
        }
        ---
        {
          <&folder> <b>marketing-site</b>
          ~/code/marketing-site -- TypeScript, Next.js
        }
      }
      .
      ---
      .
      { . | [<- Back] | . | . }
      .
    }
  }
  { . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
}
@endsalt
```

---

## 5a. New Project -- Discovery Prompt

When the user opens a folder that has no `.claude/` directory (or creates a new project), Forge offers to start a project discovery conversation instead of just scaffolding generic files.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{+
  {/ <b>Forge</b> | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
  {+
    {
      . | . | . | . | . | .
      ---
      .
      { . | <b><size:18>Project Scanned</size></b> | . | . }
      .
      { . | <b>new-saas-app</b> -- ~/code/new-saas-app | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . |
        {#
          Category | Detected
          Languages | TypeScript, Python
          Frameworks | React, FastAPI
          Build Tools | npm, pip
          VCS | Git (3 uncommitted)
          Files | 312 tracked
        }
      | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | <&warning> No governance artifacts found. | . | . }
      .
      { . | Forge can help you set up your project through | . | . }
      { . | a quick conversation about what you're building, | . | . }
      { . | your tech stack, and your conventions. | . | . }
      .
      ---
      .
      { . | [Skip -- Use Defaults] | . | [Start Project Discovery ->] | . }
      .
    }
  }
  { . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
}
@endsalt
```

### Discovery Prompt -- Empty Project Variant

For a truly new project with no code detected, the scan table is replaced with a brief message.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{+
  {/ <b>Forge</b> | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
  {+
    {
      . | . | . | . | . | .
      ---
      .
      { . | <b><size:18>New Project Created</size></b> | . | . }
      .
      { . | <b>my-app</b> -- ~/code/my-app | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | New project, no code detected. | . | . }
      { . | <&warning> No governance artifacts found. | . | . }
      .
      ---
      { . | Forge can help you set up your project through | . | . }
      { . | a quick conversation about what you're building, | . | . }
      { . | your tech stack, and your conventions. | . | . }
      .
      ---
      .
      { . | [Skip -- Use Defaults] | . | [Start Project Discovery ->] | . }
      .
    }
  }
  { . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
}
@endsalt
```

### Discovery Prompt Behavior

| Element | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Scan results table** | Shown for existing-code projects. Hidden for truly empty new projects. |
| **Start Project Discovery** | Primary action. Opens the main workspace with a discovery conversation session already in progress. |
| **Skip -- Use Defaults** | Secondary action. Creates a minimal CLAUDE.md (project name + date), empty governance directories, and opens the workspace with a blank conversation. |
| **No file list** | Unlike the old scaffold prompt, no specific files are listed — the discovery conversation determines what gets created. |

---

## 5b. New Project -- Discovery Conversation

After the user clicks "Start Project Discovery", Forge opens the main three-zone workspace with a discovery conversation already in progress. This is a regular conversation session — the discovery behavior comes from the system prompt, not special UI.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{
  {/ <b>Forge</b> | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
  {
    {
      <b>Nav Sub-Panel</b>
      ---
      <i>(empty)</i>
    }
    |
    {
      <b>Explorer</b>
      ---
      <i>No artifacts yet.</i>
      <i>Discovery in progress...</i>
      .
    }
    |
    {
      { ^Project Discovery v^ | . | ^Auto (recommended)^ }
      ---
      {SI
        <b>Claude:</b> Welcome to your new project!
        I'd like to learn about what you're
        building so I can set up governance
        artifacts tailored to your needs.
        .
        <b>What are you building? Who is it</b>
        <b>for? What problem does it solve?</b>
        .
        ---
        <b>You:</b> It's a SaaS platform for small
        teams to manage their design tokens
        and component libraries.
        ---
        <b>Claude:</b> Great -- a design system
        management tool. That helps me
        understand the domain.
        .
        <b>What tech stack are you planning?</b>
        Any preferences for languages,
        frameworks, or infrastructure?
        .
      }
      ---
      { [Type your response...              ] | [Send] }
    }
  }
}
@endsalt
```

### Discovery Conversation Behavior

| Element | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Session dropdown** | The discovery session appears as "Project Discovery" in the session dropdown — a regular session, not a special mode. |
| **Conversation** | Claude follows a system prompt that covers product, tech stack, team, conventions, and prior art. The user responds naturally. |
| **Explorer Panel** | Empty during discovery. Populates after the user approves generated artifacts. |
| **Exit anytime** | The user can close the conversation, start a new session, or say "that's enough." The discovery session persists and can be resumed. |
| **No special UI** | This is the standard three-zone layout. The discovery "magic" is entirely in the system prompt — no wizard, no special components. |

---

## 5c. New Project -- Governance Artifacts Confirmation

After discovery (or when Claude has enough context), Claude proposes artifacts. The user reviews them in a confirmation dialog before any files are written.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{+
  {/ <b>Forge</b> | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
  {+
    {
      . | . | . | . | . | .
      ---
      .
      .
      { . |
        {+
          <b>Confirm: Create Governance Artifacts</b>
          ---
          Based on our conversation, I've prepared
          these governance artifacts for your project:
          ---
          {SI
            [X] .claude/CLAUDE.md (project summary)
            [X] .claude/agents/backend-api.md
            [X] .claude/agents/frontend-ui.md
            [X] .claude/rules/conventions.md
            [X] .claude/rules/testing.md
          }
          ---
          Uncheck any files you don't want created.
          You can edit or delete them at any time.
          ---
          { [Cancel] | . | . | [Create Files] }
        }
      | . | . }
      .
      .
    }
  }
  { . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . }
}
@endsalt
```

---

## Settings in Explorer Panel -- Sidecar Error State

When the sidecar process encounters an error, the Provider section surfaces the problem.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{
  {/ <b>Settings</b> }
  ---
  {SI
    {
      <b>Provider</b>
      ---
      Claude Code CLI Path
      { [/usr/local/bin/claude           ] | [Browse...] | [Auto-detect] }
      ---
      Sidecar Status: | <&circle-x> <color:red>Error</color>
      Connection Health: | <&ban> Disconnected
      ---
      {
        <&warning> <color:red>Sidecar process exited with code 1.</color>
        Check that the CLI path is correct and
        your subscription is active.
      }
      ---
      [Restart Sidecar] | [View Logs]
    }
    ---
    .
    .
  }
}
@endsalt
```

---

## Settings in Explorer Panel -- Idle Sidecar State

When no session is active, the sidecar is idle.

```plantuml
@startsalt
{
  {/ <b>Settings</b> }
  ---
  {SI
    {
      <b>Provider</b>
      ---
      Claude Code CLI Path
      { [/usr/local/bin/claude           ] | [Browse...] | [Auto-detect] }
      ---
      Sidecar Status: | <&clock> Idle
      Connection Health: | <&signal> Connected
      ---
      Subscription: | <b>Max</b> (active)
      ---
      [Restart Sidecar]
    }
    ---
    .
    .
  }
}
@endsalt
```
