# Wireframe: Core Layout

**Date:** 2026-03-02 | **Informed by:** [Information Architecture](/product/information-architecture), [Frontend Research](/research/frontend), [Design System](/ui/design-system)

The main window structure showing all four zones: Activity Bar, Explorer Panel, Sessions Panel, and Chat Panel, plus Toolbar and Status Bar. This replaces the previous three-pane layout with a VS Code-style artifact-centric design.

### Zone Dimensions

| Zone | Default | Min | Max | Collapsible |
|------|---------|-----|-----|-------------|
| Activity Bar | 48px (fixed) | 48px | 48px | No |
| Explorer Panel | Flex (fills remaining) | 280px | — | No |
| Sessions Panel | 240px | 180px | 320px | Yes (collapse to 0px) |
| Chat Panel | Flex (fills remaining) | 360px | — | No |
| Toolbar | Full width | — | — | No |
| Status Bar | Full width | — | — | No |

Explorer and Chat share remaining horizontal space approximately 50/50 after the Activity Bar (48px) and Sessions Panel (240px) are accounted for.

### Zone Relationship to PaneForge

The Activity Bar sits **outside** PaneForge as a fixed-width CSS flex element (48px). PaneForge manages the three resizable zones: Explorer Panel | Sessions Panel | Chat Panel.

---

## Sessions Panel Collapsed State

When the Sessions Panel is collapsed via `Ctrl+B`, its space redistributes to the Explorer and Chat panels.
