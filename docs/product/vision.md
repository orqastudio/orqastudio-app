# Product Vision

**Date:** 2026-03-07

## Vision

OrqaStudio is an AI-assisted clarity engine designed to help people turn messy situations into structured understanding and evolving plans.

Rather than focusing purely on task management or software generation, OrqaStudio focuses on improving the quality of thinking that leads to action.

The platform operationalises agile thinking through AI-assisted reasoning, enabling individuals and teams to explore problems, shape ideas, design experiments, and continuously learn through structured retrospection.

## Core Principles

**Clarity before execution** — Clear thinking leads to better action. The most expensive mistake is building the wrong thing clearly, but the most common mistake is building the right thing without understanding it first.

**Human-led AI** — AI acts as a structured thinking partner rather than replacing human judgement. The human decides what matters, sets the standards, and approves the direction. AI helps explore, structure, and execute.

**Artifact-driven reasoning** — Markdown artifacts represent structured knowledge that can evolve over time. Plans, decisions, rules, retrospectives, and lessons are not ephemeral chat messages — they are living documents that accumulate into a knowledge base.

**Reflective learning** — Retrospectives and iteration history enable continuous learning. Every cycle of work produces not just output but insight about the process itself.

## The Agile Learning Loop

The core cycle that OrqaStudio operationalises:

```
Chaos --> Structured Understanding --> Experiments / Backlog --> Execution --> Retrospective --> Improved Understanding
```

Every feature in OrqaStudio serves this loop:

1. **Chaos → Structured Understanding** — AI-assisted conversations help users explore ambiguous problems, challenge assumptions, and build structured models of what they're dealing with
2. **Structured Understanding → Experiments** — Understanding produces actionable plans: experiments to run, tasks to execute, hypotheses to test
3. **Experiments → Execution** — Plans are executed with AI assistance, with governance ensuring quality and standards
4. **Execution → Retrospective** — Outcomes are reviewed. What worked? What didn't? What was learned?
5. **Retrospective → Improved Understanding** — Lessons feed back into the knowledge base. The next cycle starts from a better position than the last.

The loop is domain-agnostic. Software development is OrqaStudio's first domain — where the loop manifests as code governance, implementation cycles, and learning from agent sessions. But the underlying pattern applies wherever complex work requires structured thinking: product strategy, research, operations, consulting, and beyond.

## Entry Modes

Users arrive at OrqaStudio from different starting points. Not everyone enters with a clear task — many enter with ambiguity. The platform meets them where they are:

| Mode | Starting point | What the user needs |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Problem** | Something is not working and needs diagnosis | Understand root causes, map the situation, produce a fix plan |
| **Idea** | A concept needs validation and shaping | Explore feasibility, challenge assumptions, shape into something actionable |
| **Goal** | A desired outcome requires planning | Gap analysis, breakdown into steps, produce a backlog or experiment plan |
| **Chaos** | A messy situation needs clarity | Triage, find structure in the mess, identify what matters and what to do first |

Each entry mode supports both **new projects** (starting from scratch) and **existing work** (adapting a codebase, asset library, research corpus, or any body of work the user is already engaged with). The AI-assisted onboarding flow helps the user assess what they have, understand where they are, and create a structured thinking process around it.

Each mode triggers a different onboarding flow — different questions, different reasoning patterns, different initial artifact structures. But all four paths converge into the same agile learning loop: structured understanding → experiments → execution → retrospective → improved understanding.

The entry modes are how agile thinking is operationalised at the point of entry. The user doesn't need to know agile terminology or frameworks. They just describe their situation, and OrqaStudio guides them from wherever they are toward structured reasoning.

While software development is OrqaStudio's first domain — where implementation can be directly integrated into the structured thinking process — the entry modes are domain-agnostic by design. The same onboarding patterns apply to personal life management, healthcare project management, research planning, consulting engagements, or any situation where complex work benefits from structured thinking.

## Product Pillars

### Pillar 1: Clarity Through Structure

Making thinking visible, structured, and evolvable.

When knowledge lives only in conversations and people's heads, it is fragile — lost between sessions, invisible to collaborators, impossible to build upon systematically. OrqaStudio makes the invisible tangible:

- **Governance as visible structure** — Rules, standards, architecture decisions, and agent definitions are not hidden configuration. They are browsable, editable, first-class artifacts in the UI.
- **Artifact-driven knowledge** — Conversations produce structured markdown artifacts (plans, decisions, retrospectives) that persist and evolve across sessions
- **Process visibility** — Scanner dashboards, compliance status, and quality metrics surface what would otherwise be buried in terminal output and dotfiles
- **Documentation-first workflow** — The system enforces document → approve → implement → verify, ensuring understanding precedes action

Clarity Through Structure answers the question: *"Can I see and understand the current state of this work, its standards, and its decisions — without asking someone or reading raw files?"*

### Pillar 2: Learning Through Reflection

The system and its users improve over time through structured retrospection.

Most tools accumulate conversation history. OrqaStudio accumulates *understanding*. Every cycle of work produces not just output but insight that feeds the next cycle:

- **Lesson capture** — Mistakes and discoveries are documented with recurrence tracking, not just mentioned in chat
- **Pattern promotion** — When a lesson recurs, it is promoted to a rule, coding standard, or skill update — the governance framework evolves automatically
- **Retrospectives** — Process-level observations become entries that inform future governance evolution
- **Metrics and trends** — Pass/fail rates, quality trends, and violation recurrence are visualised over time, making improvement (or regression) visible
- **Session continuity** — Handoff notes and searchable session history prevent context loss between sessions, so each session builds on the last

Learning Through Reflection answers the question: *"Is this work getting better over time, and can I see the evidence?"*

### Pillar Relationship

The two pillars are complementary and sequential:

- **Clarity Through Structure** provides the foundation — you cannot improve a process that isn't visible and structured
- **Learning Through Reflection** operates on that foundation — structured artifacts can be measured, compared, and evolved

When they conflict, Clarity Through Structure takes priority. Governance must be solid before the learning loop can meaningfully operate on it.

## Problem

People use AI tools to help with complex work — software development, product planning, research, operations. But current AI tools operate as conversational interfaces with no structural layer. The thinking that happens in conversation is ephemeral: context is lost between sessions, standards are inconsistently applied, mistakes recur, and there is no mechanism for the process to improve over time.

For software development specifically, agentic coding tools like Claude Code are powerful but operate as developer-facing CLI tools with no product management layer. The governance framework that makes agentic development reliable — agents, skills, rules, learning loops, documentation-first workflow — lives in dotfiles, markdown documents, and terminal output. Product managers and tech leads are locked out of the implementation loop entirely.

The result across all domains: AI-assisted work produces inconsistent quality, accumulates decisions invisibly, and fails to learn from its own history.

## Solution

OrqaStudio is a desktop application that provides a structural layer for AI-assisted thinking and work.

**For any domain:** Conversations with AI produce structured artifacts — plans, decisions, retrospectives, and knowledge — that persist across sessions and evolve over time. The agile learning loop (chaos → clarity → execution → reflection → improved clarity) is operationalised through the UI.

**For software development (the first domain):** OrqaStudio integrates with Claude Code and other AI providers, making governance artifacts (agents, skills, rules, architecture decisions, learning loops) visible and manageable through a graphical interface. The same `.claude/` files that power the CLI are browsable and editable in OrqaStudio's UI. The system learns from every session and feeds improvements back into the governance framework automatically.

OrqaStudio turns ephemeral AI conversations into accumulated, structured, improving knowledge.

## Primary Users

### Structured Thinkers (Primary)

Technical product managers, tech leads, and anyone who needs to turn complex situations into structured understanding and evolving plans. They think in terms of requirements, decisions, standards, and quality — not just code or output. They want to:

- Use AI as a thinking partner to explore problems and shape ideas before committing to action
- Build up a structured knowledge base of decisions, plans, and lessons that persists across sessions
- Define standards and governance that are visible, enforceable, and improving over time
- Delegate execution to AI agents with confidence that process is followed
- Track quality and learning outcomes to know whether the work is getting better

A capable solo technical PM should be able to use OrqaStudio to build well-researched, well-considered products by defining the governance framework, delegating to agents, and reviewing results — while retaining architecture oversight and approval authority.

See [Personas](personas.md) for detailed profiles: Alex (the Lead), Sam (the Practitioner), and Jordan (the Independent).

### The Key Insight

OrqaStudio is not a developer tool that happens to have process features. It is not a chat interface that happens to save history. It is a **clarity engine** — a tool for improving the quality of thinking that leads to action.

The difference matters: the UI, the workflow, and the default experience are designed for someone who thinks in terms of understanding, decisions, and standards — not someone who thinks in terms of code editors and terminal commands. Software development is the first domain because the governance infrastructure already exists (Claude Code's `.claude/` format), but the underlying value — structured thinking that improves over time — applies far beyond code.

## Dogfooding Principle

OrqaStudio is built using OrqaStudio alongside the Claude Code CLI. Once the MVP delivers a working conversation UI with Claude integration, the project transitions from terminal-only governance to using OrqaStudio's UI as the primary governance management layer — while the CLI remains available for all development tasks.

This is not optional — it is a foundational design constraint:

- **Every feature must be good enough for OrqaStudio's own team to use daily.** If a feature isn't useful for managing this project, it isn't useful for anyone.
- **Deficiencies discovered through self-use are highest-priority fixes.** The dogfooding loop is the primary driver of roadmap priority after the MVP.
- **OrqaStudio and the CLI coexist permanently.** The transition is from "invisible governance buried in dotfiles" to "visible governance through OrqaStudio's UI." The CLI continues to work against the same `.claude/` files. See [Product Governance](governance.md) for transition criteria.

## CLI Interoperability

OrqaStudio is a companion to the Claude Code CLI, not a replacement for it. This interoperability is a foundational design constraint:

- **Shared artifact format** — All governance artifacts OrqaStudio creates (`.claude/rules/`, `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/`, `CLAUDE.md`) are native Claude Code artifacts. They work identically whether accessed through OrqaStudio's UI or the CLI.
- **Bidirectional editing** — Users can edit `.claude/` files in OrqaStudio's artifact editor, in a text editor, or through Claude Code CLI sessions. OrqaStudio's file watcher detects external changes and reflects them in the UI.
- **No lock-in** — A user can stop using OrqaStudio at any time and continue with the CLI alone. All governance artifacts remain functional on disk.
- **SQLite is a derived cache** — OrqaStudio's SQLite database stores session history, project metadata, and indexed artifact data. The `.claude/` files on disk are the source of truth for governance. If the database is deleted, OrqaStudio re-indexes from disk on next launch.
- **CLI detection** — OrqaStudio checks for Claude Code CLI availability at startup and surfaces its status in the UI. The CLI is a prerequisite for AI-powered features.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Clarity engine, not chat interface** — Conversations produce structured, persistent, evolving artifacts — not just chat history
2. **Structured thinking, not just task execution** — Designed to improve the quality of thinking that leads to action, not just generate output faster
3. **Learning that compounds** — The system genuinely gets smarter over time through the reflection loop, not just accumulating conversation history
4. **Governance made tangible** — What was invisible (standards, rules, decisions, quality trends) becomes a first-class, visual, manageable layer
5. **Native Claude Code format** — All governance artifacts are standard `.claude/` files that work identically in OrqaStudio and the CLI. No proprietary formats, no lock-in.
6. **Multi-provider architecture** — Claude is the primary provider, but the architecture supports additional AI providers through a composable provider interface
7. **Solo capability** — A technical PM can define standards, delegate to AI agents, and ship quality work with architecture oversight but without dedicated team resource
8. **Dogfooding-driven design** — OrqaStudio is its own first customer, ensuring every feature is validated by real use before release
