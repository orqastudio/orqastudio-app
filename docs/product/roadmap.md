# Roadmap

**Date:** 2026-03-04

Feature ideas and future work. Remove entries once implemented.

The roadmap enforces a strict **define before build** sequence. Phases 0a through 0e must be completed before any application code is written. This is a product management tool — it should be built like one.

---

## Phase 0a: Tech Stack Research

Research and resolve technical decision points. Each item results in documented findings in `docs/research/` with a recommendation.

**Claude Integration** — [`docs/research/claude-integration.md`](/research/claude-integration)

- [x] Claude integration approach → Agent SDK as primary (spawns official CLI, Max subscription). `tools: []` + custom MCP for control.
- [x] Claude Max integration path → Max subscription via Agent SDK. Cost-effective at 25+ conv/day. API key + other providers on roadmap.
- [x] Tool implementation strategy → Forge tools as custom MCP server exposed to Agent SDK. Native Rust execution. MCP host for extensibility.
- [x] Streaming architecture → Agent SDK → sidecar (Bun-compiled) → NDJSON stdout → Rust → Channel<T> → Svelte store.

**Tauri v2** — [`docs/research/tauri-v2.md`](/research/tauri-v2)

- [x] Tauri v2 capability audit → All 8 requirements confirmed supported
- [x] IPC design → invoke() for CRUD, Channel<T> for streaming, events for notifications
- [x] Security model → Scoped capabilities, keyring for API keys, persisted scopes
- [x] Plugin ecosystem → All 9 needed plugins exist and are stable

**Frontend** — [`docs/research/frontend.md`](/research/frontend)

- [x] Markdown rendering + editing → CodeMirror 6 (editing) + @humanspeak/svelte-markdown (rendering). No WYSIWYG.
- [x] Conversation UI component → Custom build on shadcn-svelte. Vercel AI SDK for patterns only.
- [x] Panel layout system → PaneForge (shadcn-svelte Resizable). Three-zone + nav sub-panel layout.

**Persistence** — [`docs/research/persistence.md`](/research/persistence)

- [x] SQLite schema design → 9 tables + 2 FTS5. One row per content block. rusqlite + tauri-plugin-sql.
- [x] File vs DB boundary → Hybrid: metadata + FTS in DB, content from disk. notify file watcher.
- [x] Session persistence model → Full history (<5 GB/year). FTS5 cross-session search. Rule-based handoff.

**Onboarding** — [`docs/research/onboarding.md`](/research/onboarding)

- [x] Codebase scanning strategy → Three-tier hybrid: manifest heuristics + hyperpolyglot + Claude on-demand.
- [x] Governance framework format → .claude/ on disk (authoritative) + SQLite metadata (derived cache).
- [x] Progressive disclosure → Conversation-first. Feature gates in SQLite. Value in <1 minute.

## Phase 1: Scaffold — COMPLETE

**Prerequisites:** Phases 0a–0e complete and approved.

Phase 1 delivered a working Tauri v2 app with Claude conversations via Agent SDK sidecar, 40+ IPC commands, 91 Svelte components, full CRUD, streaming, and semantic code search (ONNX embeddings + DuckDB).

- [x] Initialize Tauri v2 + Svelte 5 project with configured plugins
- [x] Rust backend: Claude API client with streaming (Agent SDK sidecar)
- [x] Rust backend: Channel<T> streaming to frontend
- [x] Rust backend: SQLite setup with initial schema + migrations
- [x] Rust backend: Session CRUD commands
- [x] Rust backend: API key storage via keyring — *Deferred: Max subscription uses OAuth via Claude CLI, not API keys*
- [x] Frontend: Main layout (four-zone layout per AD-018/AD-019)
- [x] Frontend: Conversation component with streaming token display
- [x] Frontend: Tool call rendering (collapsible cards with input/output)
- [x] Frontend: Session dropdown in Chat Panel header
- [x] Frontend: Settings view (provider config, model selection)
- [x] Integration: Send message → stream response → render in UI
- [x] Integration: Basic tool call display (read-only)
- [x] First working demo: chat with Claude in the desktop app — *Partially complete: echo sidecar works E2E, real Agent SDK sidecar needs Bun build*
- [x] Semantic code search: ONNX embeddings + DuckDB vector search + startup model download

---

> **Core Principle: Native Claude Code Artifacts First**
>
> Every capability in Phase 2 is implemented via native `.claude/` artifacts (hooks, rules, skills, CLAUDE.md) first, so it works in the CLI without Forge. Forge then adds visual management, dashboards, and enhanced UX on top. This means Forge is always additive — it never creates vendor lock-in against the Claude Code CLI.

## Phase 2a: First-Run Setup Wizard

**Prerequisites:** Phase 1 complete.

A version-gated setup wizard that runs on first launch. Detects what's configured (Claude CLI, authentication, sidecar, embedding model), skips completed steps, and guides through missing ones. Re-triggers when new requirements are added in future builds by incrementing a setup version constant.

- [ ] Backend: Setup domain types (SetupStatus, SetupStepStatus, ClaudeCliInfo)
- [ ] Backend: Setup commands (check_claude_cli, check_claude_auth, check_embedding_model, get_setup_status, complete_setup)
- [ ] Backend: Version-gated setup check on app launch
- [ ] Frontend: SetupWizard full-screen overlay component
- [ ] Frontend: ClaudeCliStep — CLI detection + install guidance
- [ ] Frontend: ClaudeAuthStep — Auth detection + login flow
- [ ] Frontend: SidecarStep — Sidecar startup with status
- [ ] Frontend: EmbeddingModelStep — Model download with progress
- [ ] Frontend: SetupComplete — Completion confirmation
- [ ] Frontend: SetupStore — step state, detection results, actions
- [ ] Frontend: Mount wizard in AppLayout when setup incomplete
- [ ] Settings: Provider section shows CLI version, auth status, re-auth button
- [ ] Design doc: [`docs/architecture/setup-wizard.md`](/architecture/setup-wizard)

## Phase 2b: Governance Bootstrap

**Prerequisites:** Phase 2a complete (sidecar running).

When a user opens a project, Claude (via sidecar) scans existing governance files, analyzes them, and generates recommendations. Output is native Claude Code artifacts (`.claude/rules/*.md`, `.claude/hooks/*.sh`, `.claude/agents/*.md`, etc.). Can also translate from other tool formats (Cursor, Copilot, Continue) into Claude Code artifacts.

- [ ] Backend: Governance domain types (GovernanceScanResult, Recommendation, etc.)
- [ ] Backend: Governance scanner — filesystem walk to collect .claude/ and other governance files
- [ ] Backend: Governance repo — CRUD for analyses and recommendations (SQLite)
- [ ] Backend: Governance commands (governance_scan, recommendations_list, recommendation_update, recommendation_apply)
- [ ] Backend: Migration 002 — governance_analyses and governance_recommendations tables
- [ ] Frontend: GovernanceBootstrapWizard — wizard overlay on project open
- [ ] Frontend: GovernanceScanPanel — scan results and coverage indicator
- [ ] Frontend: RecommendationList + RecommendationCard — review and approve/reject
- [ ] Frontend: GovernanceStore — scan state, analysis state, recommendations
- [ ] Frontend: Trigger governance scan on project open
- [ ] Frontend: Dashboard governance health badge
- [ ] Design doc: [`docs/architecture/governance-bootstrap.md`](/architecture/governance-bootstrap)

## Phase 2c: Artifact Editing

**Prerequisites:** Phase 2b complete.

Edit agents, rules, skills, and hooks directly in the Forge UI. Forge becomes the primary interface for managing governance artifacts, with file watcher support so CLI and text editor edits are reflected in real time.

- [ ] Artifact editor component with markdown/YAML editing (CodeMirror 6)
- [ ] Create new artifacts from templates
- [ ] File watcher for external changes (CLI or text editor edits)
- [ ] Validation and linting for artifact formats

## Phase 2d: Self-Learning Loop

**Prerequisites:** Phase 2c complete.

Implements the learning loop as native Claude Code hooks and rules first (works in CLI), then adds Forge-only dashboards for visibility and management.

**Native artifacts:**
- [ ] Hooks that capture lessons after sessions (post-session hook writes to `docs/development/lessons.md`)
- [ ] Rules enforcing lesson checking before implementation
- [ ] CLAUDE.md section describing the promotion pipeline (lesson → rule → scanner → enforcement)

**Forge enhancements:**
- [ ] Lesson dashboard with recurrence trends (LayerChart)
- [ ] Browse/edit lessons UI
- [ ] Automated promotion suggestions (when recurrence >= threshold)
- [ ] Session analytics (pass/fail rates, coverage trends)

## Phase 2e: Enforcement & Continuity

**Prerequisites:** Phase 2d complete.

Implements rule injection and violation detection as native hooks (works in CLI), then adds Forge-only real-time streaming analysis and session handoff UI.

**Native artifacts:**
- [ ] Hooks that inject relevant rules into conversations based on file context
- [ ] Hooks that detect violations and log them

**Forge enhancements:**
- [ ] Real-time violation detection during streaming (pattern matching on streamed tokens)
- [ ] Visual compliance dashboard
- [ ] Session handoff and continuity (cross-session search, handoff summaries)

## Phase 3: File Tools & MCP

← research: [Claude Integration](/research/claude-integration) (tool implementation), [Tauri v2](/research/tauri-v2) (fs plugin, security scopes); AD: [AD-010](/architecture/decisions), [AD-011](/architecture/decisions)

- [ ] Implement file tools (Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep) in Rust backend
- [ ] Tool call approval flow (approve/deny/modify before execution)
- [ ] Project file tree panel in UI
- [ ] File viewer/editor panel (markdown rendering + code highlighting) ← research: [Frontend](/research/frontend) (CodeMirror, markdown rendering)
- [ ] Git status integration (show modified files, branch info)

## Phase 4: Process Visibility

← research: [Onboarding](/research/onboarding) (governance format), [Frontend](/research/frontend) (LayerChart for dashboard); AD: [AD-015](/architecture/decisions)

- [ ] Scanner runner and dashboard (pass/fail history, violation details)
- [ ] Metrics dashboard with KPI cards (LayerChart)
- [ ] Agent activity panel (which agent is working, what tools it's using)
- [ ] Documentation panel (browse, render, edit project docs)

## Phase 5: Discovery & Research

← product: [Personas](/product/personas) (Alex: PM/Tech Lead), [Journeys](/product/journeys); research: [Persistence](/research/persistence) (FTS5 search)

Research and discovery as a managed artifact within Forge, giving the PM persona tooling for the define-before-build workflow.

- [ ] Research artifact type (structured objects, not just markdown — queryable, filterable)
- [ ] Decision traceability graph (research → AD → feature → implementation)
- [ ] Research-to-AD promotion workflow
- [ ] Discovery dashboard (open questions, pending decisions, implementation readiness)
- [ ] Phase gate management (define phases with prerequisites, track completion)
- [ ] Conversational research workflow (Claude-assisted investigation producing structured artifacts)

## Future: Provider Ecosystem

The provider-agnostic sidecar interface supports additional providers without changing the Rust core or Svelte UI. Each provider is a new implementation behind the same `ProviderEvent` protocol. ← AD: [AD-017](/architecture/decisions); research: [Claude Integration](/research/claude-integration)

- [ ] API key provider (Anthropic TypeScript SDK — direct HTTP, pay-per-token)
- [ ] Cloud provider routing (Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, Azure AI Foundry)
- [ ] Alternative model providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, open-weight models)
- [ ] Local model support (Ollama, llama.cpp — for offline/air-gapped use)

## Future: Multi-User Collaborative Access

A small team (PM, Tech Lead, Developer) sharing a single Forge instance with visibility into each other's sessions and governance work. Schema includes nullable `user_id` and `last_edited_by` columns from Phase 1 to avoid migration-heavy changes later. ← research: [Persistence](/research/persistence) (multi-user considerations); product: [Personas](/product/personas)

- [ ] User identity and authentication (local accounts or SSO)
- [ ] Session visibility controls (own, team, all)
- [ ] Artifact edit locking or conflict resolution
- [ ] Shared vs. personal settings
- [ ] Server component for concurrent multi-machine access
- [ ] Connection pooling — current `Mutex<Connection>` is fine for single-user but becomes a bottleneck under concurrent access. Swap to `r2d2`/`deadpool-sqlite` pool (2-4 read + 1 write). Code-level refactor, no schema changes.
- [ ] Evaluate SQLite vs. PostgreSQL — SQLite is single-writer; true multi-machine concurrent access may require a server-backed database

## Future: Wireframe Browser & Interactive UX Flows

Wireframes are generated as styled images during Phase 0d and stored in a local image cache. This future work makes them a first-class browsable, interactive artifact within Forge. ← research: [Wireframing](/research/wireframing), [Design Tokens](/research/design-tokens); product: [Journeys](/product/journeys)

- [ ] Wireframe browser view — Browse all wireframes for a project, organized by UX flow / journey
- [ ] Custom markdown block for wireframe images — Renders cached wireframes with style-awareness (serves light/dark/brand variant based on active theme)
- [ ] Interactive UX flow navigation — Custom markdown block that links wireframe images into clickable flows, allowing users to navigate through screens as part of an interactive review process
- [ ] On-demand wireframe regeneration — When design tokens change (new brand colors, theme switch), regenerate wireframe variants from source definitions
- [ ] Wireframe-to-component traceability — Link wireframe screens to the Svelte components that implement them


## Future: Design Tool Integration

Rather than building comprehensive design tooling internally, integrate with 3rd-party design tools where designers already work. This enables a **Designer persona** to complete the end-to-end team (PM/Tech Lead + Developer + Designer) and avoids reinventing design tooling. ← research: [Design Tokens](/research/design-tokens); product: [Personas](/product/personas)

- [ ] Figma integration — Import design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) from Figma files. Use Figma MCP server for two-way communication. Extract component specifications from Figma designs.
- [ ] Design token sync — Bidirectional sync between project design tokens and external design tools. Changes in Figma propagate to Forge's per-project theme; governance-defined tokens can be pushed back. ← research: [Design Tokens](/research/design-tokens)
- [ ] Design-to-wireframe pipeline — Import high-fidelity designs from Figma as wireframe references. Link designs to user journeys and UX flows within Forge.
- [ ] Code-to-Figma backfill — Analyze existing frontend implementation (components, styles, layout) and generate corresponding Figma components that accurately represent them. Use those components to reconstruct wireframes as Figma designs, enabling teams who prototyped in code to backfill a proper design system. This bridges the gap to Figma's dev tools pipeline for full design-to-development integration. Potentially unique in the market — no existing tool automates code→Figma component generation at this level.
- [ ] Designer persona — Extend the persona model with a Designer role who defines visual standards, reviews UI compliance, and manages the design system through Forge's governance framework. ← product: [Personas](/product/personas)
- [ ] Replace automated wireframing — If Figma integration matures, automated wireframe generation becomes optional. Designers create wireframes in their native tool; Forge indexes and organizes them.
