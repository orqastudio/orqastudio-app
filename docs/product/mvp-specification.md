# MVP Feature Specification

**Date:** 2026-03-02

Exactly what Phase 1 delivers, with acceptance criteria for each feature. Scoped to the minimum needed for dogfooding — Forge must be able to manage its own development after this phase.

**Guiding principle:** Ship the smallest thing that lets us stop using the CLI-based bootstrap process for Forge's own development. Every feature below serves the dogfooding milestone. Features that would be nice but aren't needed for dogfooding are listed under "Explicitly Deferred."

## MVP Features

### F-001: Project Open & Codebase Scan

**Description:** User can open a project directory. Forge scans the codebase and populates project metadata.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can open a directory via native file dialog (tauri-plugin-dialog)
- [ ] Tier 1 scan (manifest heuristics) completes in < 100ms and detects: languages, frameworks, package manager, project name
- [ ] Tier 1 scan also detects design system tokens: `tailwind.config.*` theme colors/fonts, CSS custom properties in `:root`, component library conventions
- [ ] Tier 2 scan (hyperpolyglot) completes in < 5s for projects up to 10,000 files
- [ ] Detected metadata (including design tokens) is stored in SQLite and displayed in sidebar Project tab
- [ ] If design tokens are found, Forge's UI theme adapts to match the project's color palette (per-project theming). Missing tokens fall back to Forge defaults.
- [ ] If `.claude/` directory exists, governance artifacts are indexed and counts displayed
- [ ] Last-opened project is remembered across app restarts (tauri-plugin-store)
- [ ] Empty project (no recognized files) shows a meaningful empty state

### F-001b: New Project Workflow

**Description:** User can create a brand new project from scratch. Forge initializes the directory structure, scaffolds a `.claude/` governance skeleton, and drops the user into a conversation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*Directory and registration:*
- [ ] "New Project" action is available alongside "Open Project" (toolbar or welcome state)
- [ ] User provides a project name and selects a parent directory (or selects an existing empty directory)
- [ ] Forge creates the project directory (if needed) with: `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/hooks/`, `docs/`, `.gitignore` (with `forge.db`)
- [ ] If the directory is not a git repo, Forge offers to run `git init`
- [ ] Project is registered in SQLite and set as active
- [ ] Sidebar shows the new project with "New project, no code detected" status
- [ ] The scaffolded `.claude/` structure is fully compatible with Claude Code CLI
- [ ] Empty artifact browser categories show actionable empty states ("Create your first agent")

*Project discovery conversation:*
- [ ] After directory creation, Forge offers to start a project discovery conversation (not a wizard)
- [ ] The discovery session uses a system prompt that structures the conversation through product definition, tech stack, team, conventions, and prior art topics
- [ ] User answers naturally in conversation — Claude synthesizes the responses and asks follow-ups
- [ ] The system prompt guides Claude to cover all topics but does not enforce a rigid order
- [ ] User can say "that's enough" or "skip" at any point to end discovery early
- [ ] At the end of discovery, Claude proposes governance artifacts based on the conversation
- [ ] User reviews and approves, modifies, or rejects each proposed artifact before it is written to disk
- [ ] Generated CLAUDE.md contains a project summary derived from the conversation (product description, tech stack, team, key decisions)
- [ ] Generated agents are tailored to the stated tech stack (not generic defaults)
- [ ] Generated rules reflect stated conventions and preferences
- [ ] The discovery conversation is saved as a regular session (appears in session history, is searchable and resumable)
- [ ] User can skip discovery entirely via a "Skip — Use Defaults" action and start with generic scaffolding
- [ ] Skipping creates a minimal CLAUDE.md (project name + date) with empty governance directories

### F-002: Agent SDK Sidecar Lifecycle

**Description:** Forge spawns, monitors, and communicates with the Agent SDK sidecar process.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Sidecar binary is bundled with the application (Bun-compiled, ~18-25 MB)
- [ ] Sidecar spawns via `tauri-plugin-shell` `spawn()` on first conversation request
- [ ] Sidecar communicates via stdin/stdout NDJSON protocol
- [ ] Health check: Forge detects if sidecar exits unexpectedly and reports status
- [ ] If Claude Code CLI is not available, Forge shows a clear error with installation guidance
- [ ] Status bar shows sidecar state: not started, starting, connected, error
- [ ] Sidecar process is terminated cleanly on app close

### F-003: Conversation Streaming

**Description:** User can send messages and receive streaming AI responses in real-time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] User can type a message in the input area and send with Enter
- [ ] Shift+Enter inserts a newline without sending
- [ ] Message is sent to sidecar via stdin NDJSON
- [ ] Response tokens stream into the conversation panel character by character
- [ ] Streaming uses the pipeline: sidecar stdout → Rust NDJSON parser → Channel<T> → Svelte `$state` → DOM
- [ ] First token appears in < 2 seconds after send (network permitting)
- [ ] Complete messages are rendered as markdown (headings, bold, italic, code blocks, lists)
- [ ] Code blocks have syntax highlighting (svelte-highlight)
- [ ] User messages are visually distinct from assistant messages
- [ ] The conversation auto-scrolls during streaming (scroll-to-bottom behavior)
- [ ] User can scroll up during streaming without being snapped back to bottom
- [ ] Error responses (sidecar errors, provider errors) display as error blocks in the conversation
- [ ] Model selector includes "Auto (recommended)" as the default option when the provider supports auto model selection
- [ ] Auto delegates model choice to the provider; the sidecar resolves to the best available model based on rate limits and availability
- [ ] If the provider does not support auto, the Auto option is hidden and a specific model must be selected

### F-004: Tool Call Display

**Description:** Tool calls made by the AI during a conversation are displayed as collapsible cards.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tool calls appear inline in the conversation at the point where the AI invoked them
- [ ] Each tool call card shows: tool name, input summary (truncated), status badge (completed/error)
- [ ] Cards are collapsed by default, showing only the summary line
- [ ] Expanding a card reveals: full input parameters, full output/result
- [ ] File-related tool calls show the file path prominently
- [ ] Edit/Write tool calls show a diff view when expanded (additions green, deletions red)
- [ ] Command tool calls show the command and output with monospace formatting
- [ ] Tool result errors are visually distinct (error styling)
- [ ] Cards are read-only in Phase 1 (no approval/denial controls)

### F-005: Session Persistence

**Description:** Sessions are saved automatically and can be browsed, resumed, and searched.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Sessions are created automatically when the first message is sent
- [ ] Session metadata (title, created_at, updated_at, message_count, model) is stored in SQLite. The `model` field stores `"auto"` as a string value when auto model selection is active (not null).
- [ ] Messages and content blocks are stored in SQLite (one row per content block)
- [ ] Sessions are auto-titled from the first user message (first 50 characters)
- [ ] Session list appears in the sidebar Sessions tab, ordered by most recent
- [ ] Clicking a session in the list loads it in the conversation view with full message history
- [ ] The active session is highlighted in the list
- [ ] New Session button (`Ctrl+N`) creates a new empty session
- [ ] Sessions persist across app restarts
- [ ] The last-active session is restored on app restart

### F-006: Four-Zone Layout

**Description:** The main window uses a VS Code-style four-zone layout: Activity Bar (fixed 48px icon rail), Explorer Panel (flexible, artifact-centric), Sessions Panel (240px, collapsible), and Chat Panel (flexible, conversation).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Activity Bar is a fixed 48px vertical icon rail on the far left, outside PaneForge
- [ ] Activity Bar has icons for: Docs (default active), Agents, Rules, Skills, Hooks (lifecycle + hookify); separator; Settings (bottom-aligned)
- [ ] Active Activity Bar icon has 2px left border indicator + highlighted background
- [ ] `Ctrl+1` through `Ctrl+5` switch artifact categories; `Ctrl+,` opens settings
- [ ] Explorer Panel fills remaining space, shows content based on Activity Bar selection
- [ ] Sessions Panel: default 240px, min 180px, max 320px, collapsible with `Ctrl+B`
- [ ] Sessions Panel has two tabs: Sessions (default) and Project
- [ ] Chat Panel fills remaining space, always shows conversation, not collapsible
- [ ] PaneForge manages three resizable zones: Explorer | Sessions | Chat
- [ ] Pane resize handles are visible and draggable
- [ ] Collapsed Sessions Panel redistributes space to Explorer and Chat
- [ ] Panel sizes and collapse state persist across app restarts (tauri-plugin-window-state)
- [ ] Window size and position persist across restarts
- [ ] Layout is functional at minimum window size of 900x600px
- [ ] Responsive: Sessions Panel auto-collapses below 1200px; overlay Sheet below 720px

### F-007: Artifact Browser

**Description:** User can browse governance artifacts (agents, rules, skills, hooks, docs) in the Explorer Panel.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Explorer Panel shows the artifact browser when an artifact category is active in the Activity Bar
- [ ] Activity Bar icons select the artifact category — no tab bar within the Explorer Panel
- [ ] Each tab lists artifacts found in the corresponding `.claude/` subdirectory (or `docs/` for documentation)
- [ ] Each list entry shows: filename, brief description (from YAML frontmatter `description` or first paragraph)
- [ ] The Hooks category displays both lifecycle hooks (from `.claude/hooks/`) and hookify rules (from `.claude/hookify.*.local.md`), distinguishable by a subtype indicator
- [ ] Hookify rules display their event type (file edit / bash command), action (block / warn), and pattern summary
- [ ] Users can filter the Hooks list by subtype: All, Lifecycle, Hookify
- [ ] Clicking an artifact opens it in the Explorer Panel artifact viewer (conversation stays visible in Chat Panel)
- [ ] Artifact viewer renders markdown content with proper formatting
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is displayed as structured metadata above the rendered body
- [ ] File watcher detects changes to `.claude/` files (including `hookify.*.local.md`) and updates the browser within 500ms
- [ ] Empty categories show a meaningful empty state

- [ ] CodeMirror editor has markdown syntax highlighting
- [ ] YAML frontmatter is editable within the same editor
- [ ] `Ctrl+S` saves the file to disk immediately
- [ ] After save, switching back to rendered view shows updated content
- [ ] Unsaved changes are indicated visually (modified indicator in title)
- [ ] Closing the editor with unsaved changes prompts: save, discard, or cancel
- [ ] "New" button in artifact browser creates a template file and opens it in edit mode

**Architecture References:** AD-013 (CodeMirror 6), AD-015 (governance format)

### F-010: Status Bar

**Description:** A status bar at the bottom of the window shows connection and system status.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Status bar spans full window width
- [ ] Shows sidecar connection status: icon + text (Not started / Starting / Connected / Error)
- [ ] Shows active model name (e.g., "Opus 4.6") when a specific model is pinned
- [ ] When Auto model selection is active, shows the resolved model: "Auto → Sonnet 4.6" (updated when streaming begins and the sidecar reports the resolved model)
- [ ] Shows token usage for current session (input tokens / output tokens) — updated per message
- [ ] Status indicators use color coding: green (healthy), yellow (degraded), red (error)

**Architecture References:** AD-007 (sidecar), AD-013 (frontend libraries)

### F-011: SQLite Infrastructure

**Description:** SQLite database with schema, migrations, and the core tables needed for Phase 1.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Database file is created in the Tauri app data directory
- [ ] Schema is applied via migrations (tauri-plugin-sql)
- [ ] Phase 1 tables exist: projects, sessions, messages, message_blocks, artifacts, feature_gates
- [ ] FTS5 virtual table exists for session message search (infrastructure ready, UI deferred)
- [ ] WAL mode is enabled for concurrent read/write
- [ ] Database operations use `rusqlite` on the Rust side
- [ ] Frontend queries use `tauri-plugin-sql` via invoke commands

**Architecture References:** AD-014 (persistence), AD-005 (SQLite)

---

### F-012: MCP Tool Server

**Description:** Forge's tools are exposed as a custom MCP server that the Agent SDK sidecar connects to.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Forge implements an MCP server that the sidecar registers as `mcpServers: { "forge": ... }`
- [ ] Agent SDK's built-in tools are disabled (`tools: []`)
- [ ] File tools are available: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep
- [ ] Shell tool is available: Bash (scoped execution)
- [ ] Tool calls from the AI route through the sidecar to Forge's MCP server
- [ ] Tool results are returned to the AI via the MCP protocol
- [ ] Tools execute natively in Rust (not shelling out)
- [ ] Tool execution respects Tauri security scopes (no access outside project root + home)

**Architecture References:** AD-010 (tool implementation as MCP), AD-011 (security model)

### F-013: Session Handoff Summaries

**Description:** When a session ends, Forge generates a Claude-powered summary that captures what happened, what's unfinished, and what the next session should know. Context loss between sessions is the #1 pain point.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] When a session ends (user starts a new session, or explicitly closes the current one), the sidecar generates a handoff summary
- [ ] Summary prompt includes: what was accomplished, what was in progress, key decisions made, open questions/blockers, files being modified
- [ ] Summary is stored in `sessions.summary` and `sessions.handoff_notes`
- [ ] Summary is kept under 500 words
- [ ] When a new session starts for the same project, handoff notes from the most recent session are included in the system prompt
- [ ] If the sidecar is unavailable (e.g., app closing quickly), a rule-based fallback generates a basic summary from: last user message, files modified (from tool calls), tool call count
- [ ] Handoff notes are visible in the session list (expandable preview)
- [ ] Generating the summary does not block the user from starting the next session (async generation)

## Explicitly Deferred (Not in Phase 1)

These features are valuable but not needed for the dogfooding milestone:

| Feature | Reason for Deferral | Target Phase |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Tool call approval flow | Read-only tool display sufficient for dogfooding | Phase 2 |
| Global search UI | FTS5 infrastructure exists, UI can wait | Phase 2 |
| Project file tree panel | Can browse files through conversation tool calls | Phase 2 |
| Scanner dashboard | No scanners to run yet | Phase 3 |
| Metrics dashboard | No metrics data yet | Phase 5 |
| Learning loop (IMPL capture, promotion) | Process benefit, not blocking dogfooding | Phase 5 |
| Conversational governance backfill | Can manually create/edit artifacts in Phase 1 | Phase 4 |
| Multi-project switching | Single project sufficient for dogfooding | Phase 2 |
| API key provider | Max subscription is primary path | Future |
| Cross-session search UI | FTS5 ready, UI deferred | Phase 2 |
| Multi-user collaborative access | Single-user desktop app first; schema includes nullable user_id for future expansion | Future |

---

## Dogfooding Validation Checklist

After Phase 1 is complete, Forge must pass these checks to transition from the CLI bootstrap process:

- [ ] **Can browse governance artifacts**: Open Forge, navigate to artifact browser, see agents/rules/skills/hooks listed, view their content rendered as markdown
- [ ] **Can edit governance artifacts**: Edit an agent file, save, verify change persists on disk and in the UI
- [ ] **Can run a conversation**: Send a message, receive a streaming response, see tool calls displayed
- [ ] **Can review tool calls**: Expand a tool call card, see the input and output, understand what the AI did
- [ ] **Can manage sessions**: Start a new session, switch between sessions, see session history
- [ ] **Can detect project context**: Open Forge on the Forge project itself, see detected stack and existing governance artifacts
- [ ] **Persistence works**: Close Forge, reopen, last session and project are restored
