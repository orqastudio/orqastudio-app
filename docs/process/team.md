# The Agentic Development Team

**Date:** 2026-03-02

OrqaStudio™ uses an agentic development model: one orchestrator coordinates, and specialized subagents implement. This page defines the team structure, each agent's role, the skills available to them, and how review gates work.

---

## Team Model

| Role | Participant | Responsibilities |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Product Manager** | User (human) | Defines vision, pillars, priorities. Approves feature scope. Makes decisions when product principles conflict. |
| **Tech Lead** | User (human) | Approves implementation plans before coding begins. Reviews architecture decisions. Provides technical oversight. Final authority on technical approach. |
| **Scrum Master / Dev Lead** | Orchestrator (Claude Code main session) | Reads TODO.md, creates worktrees, delegates to agents, gates on DoR/DoD, merges completed work, runs post-merge verification. |
| **Implementation Team** | Specialized agents | Implement delegated tasks end-to-end. Load skills. Run quality checks. Report results. |

The Product Manager and Tech Lead roles may be filled by the same person if they have the skillset. Both are human gates — no implementation proceeds without explicit user approval of the plan.

The orchestrator does NOT implement code directly. Its job is coordination, delegation, and gating. See [Orchestration](/process/orchestration) for the full orchestrator protocol.

## Agent Directory

All 15 agents are defined in `.orqa/agents/`. Each is invoked via the Task tool with `subagent_type`.

## Skill Directory

Skills are domain-specific instruction sets stored in `.orqa/skills/`. They follow the open [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard and must be portable -- no OrqaStudio-specific architectural rules in skills.

| Skill | Source | Domain | Loaded By |
|-------|--------|--------|-----------|
| `chunkhound` | Custom (Alvarez) | Semantic code search: search_regex, search_semantic, code_research | ALL agents |
| `planning` | Custom (Alvarez) | Discuss-Agree-Plan-Approve-Implement-Verify methodology | orchestrator, agent-maintainer, systems-architect |
| `skills-maintenance` | Custom (Alvarez) | skills.sh CLI, skill lifecycle, portability rules, audit protocol | agent-maintainer |
| `architecture` | Custom (Alvarez) | ADR pattern, data flow mapping, architectural violations | systems-architect, documentation-writer |
| `svelte5-best-practices` | skills.sh registry | Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived, $effect), component patterns | frontend-engineer, designer, debugger, code-reviewer, qa-tester, ux-reviewer |
| `typescript-advanced-types` | skills.sh registry | Strict TypeScript, readonly types, string literal unions | frontend-engineer, debugger, code-reviewer, test-engineer, refactor-agent, qa-tester, ux-reviewer |
| `tailwind-design-system` | skills.sh registry | Tailwind CSS utilities, theme variables, design tokens | frontend-engineer, designer, ux-reviewer |
| `rust-async-patterns` | skills.sh registry | Rust async/await, tokio, error handling, lifetimes | backend-engineer, data-engineer, debugger, code-reviewer, test-engineer, security-engineer, refactor-agent |
| `tauri-v2` | skills.sh registry | Tauri v2 commands, Channel&lt;T&gt;, plugins, security model | backend-engineer, debugger, devops-engineer, security-engineer, systems-architect |

## Review Gates

Every task passes through independent review agents before it is marked complete. The implementing agent does not self-certify.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Impl["Implementing Agent"] -->|commits| CR["code-reviewer<br/>Static quality"]
    CR -->|PASS| QA["qa-tester<br/>Functional correctness"]
    QA -->|PASS| UX["ux-reviewer<br/>UX compliance<br/>(if UI-facing)"]
    UX -->|PASS| Done["Task Complete"]
    CR -->|FAIL| Fix["Fix and resubmit"]
    QA -->|FAIL| Fix
    UX -->|FAIL| Fix
    Fix --> CR
```

| Reviewer | Evaluates |
|----------|-----------|
| `code-reviewer` | clippy/rustfmt/ESLint/svelte-check zero errors; no stubs; 80%+ coverage; doc layer compliance; DoD code items |
| `qa-tester` | End-to-end functional correctness from a user perspective; smoke test; DoD smoke test items |
| `ux-reviewer` | Labels match docs/ui/ specs; all component states handled; shared components used; no jargon in UI; DoD UI items |

Review failures generate entries in [Implementation Lessons](/development/lessons). The agent-maintainer promotes recurring failures to rules or standards.

## Content Ownership

Each layer of the governance system owns a specific type of content. For the full framework, see [Content Governance](/process/content-governance). The `agent-maintainer` owns hookify rule files alongside lifecycle hooks.

| Layer | Owns |
|-------|------|
| `docs/` | Standards, IPC contracts, architecture decisions -- source of truth |
| `.orqa/agents/` | Process: how agents work, what to read, when to delegate |
| `.orqa/skills/` | Technology patterns -- portable, no OrqaStudio-specific rules |
| `.orqa/rules/` | Behavioral enforcement -- applies to all agents automatically |
| `.orqa/hooks/` | Lifecycle hooks -- shell scripts triggered by lifecycle events (session start, stop, pre-commit) |
| `.claude/hookify.*.local.md` | Hookify rules -- action-boundary enforcement that blocks or warns on specific patterns in file edits or bash commands |
