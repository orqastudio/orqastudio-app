# Development Workflow

**Date:** 2026-03-02

This page documents the task process: how to start a task, run it, complete it, and hand it off. It does not restate coding standards or architecture decisions -- those live in their own documents and are referenced here.

---

## Session Checklist

Copy and complete at the start of every implementation session:

```text
[ ] Created worktree: git worktree add ../orqa-<task> -b <branch>
[ ] Working in worktree (NOT main)
[ ] Re-read relevant implementation plan and governing docs
[ ] Loaded relevant skills (Skill tool) including chunkhound
[ ] Checked development/lessons.md for known patterns in this area
[ ] Ready to write tests FIRST
```

---

## Git Worktree Workflow (MANDATORY)

All agents MUST use worktrees. NO direct work on main.

For the full worktree protocol including background process discipline, Windows-specific process killing, and post-merge verification, see `.orqa/rules/git-workflow.md`.

**Quick reference:**

```bash
# 1. START -- Create worktree
git worktree add ../orqa-<task-name> -b <agent>/<task-description>
cd ../orqa-<task-name>

# 2. WORK -- Make changes, commit regularly

# 3. VERIFY -- All checks must pass before review
# Backend (Rust):
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test

# Frontend:
npm run check && npm run lint && npm run test

# 4. REVIEW -- Request code-reviewer approval
# Do NOT merge until approved

# 5. MERGE -- Only after approval
cd ../orqa && git merge <branch>
git branch -d <branch>
git worktree remove ../orqa-<task-name>

# 6. POST-MERGE VERIFICATION
cargo build && npm run build
```

**Branch naming:** `<agent>/<task>` (e.g., `backend/session-commands`, `frontend/scanner-dashboard`)

---

## Merge Conflict Handling (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Merge conflicts are the primary source of lost work. Every conflict MUST be resolved carefully.

**Resolution rules:**

1. **Task changes take priority** in files the task modified
2. **Preserve unrelated main changes** in shared files
3. **NEVER discard task work** to resolve a conflict
4. **NEVER discard unrelated main work**
5. **Both sides can be correct** -- many conflicts require keeping BOTH sides (two new imports, two new functions)

**Verification after merge:**

1. `git diff HEAD~1 --stat` -- review what actually changed
2. Verify ALL task deliverables are present in the merged code
3. Verify NO unrelated main work was accidentally deleted
4. Run quality checks to catch integration issues
5. If a file was modified by both sides, read the merged result -- do not assume the merge tool got it right

---

## Task Lifecycle Protocol

### Before Starting a Task

1. Check the [Definition of Ready](/process/definition-of-ready) -- verify all applicable items
2. Verify the artifact trail -- confirm an `EPIC-NNN` exists with `status: ready` and `docs-required` gate satisfied
3. Check `BLOCKERS.md` -- ensure the task is not blocked
4. Read the full task description including scope, action, and acceptance criteria
5. Run `code_research` in ChunkHound to understand existing code you will modify

### During a Task

1. Follow the plan exactly -- if the plan says "create file X with methods A, B, C", create all three
2. If the plan doesn't work -- write the issue to `BLOCKERS.md` with tag `PLAN_DEVIATION`, do NOT silently change approach
3. Commit regularly -- every meaningful unit of work gets a commit

### After Completing a Task

1. Run acceptance criteria -- execute the specific checks listed for this task
2. Verify the [Definition of Done](/process/definition-of-done) -- all applicable items must be satisfied
3. Request review from `code-reviewer`, then `qa-tester`, then `ux-reviewer` (if UI-facing)
4. Update `TODO.md` -- mark the task `[x]`
5. Update the epic's task checklist and status in `.orqa/epics/EPIC-NNN.md`
6. Verify all `docs-produced` items from the epic have been created or updated
7. Update the parent milestone's `completed-epics` count if the epic is now `done`
8. Log any new patterns discovered in `.orqa/lessons/`

---

## Commit Message Convention

All commits MUST reference the plan task ID:

```text
[2.1] Add session persistence Tauri commands

- Created save_session and load_session commands
- Added SessionState struct with Serialize/Deserialize
- All existing tests pass

Co-Authored-By: Claude <agent>
```

Format: `[task_id] Short description`

---

## Cold Start Protocol

When starting a new session, resuming after context compaction, or picking up a task with no prior context:

1. **Read `TODO.md`** -- understand current phase, assigned tasks, and overall progress
2. **Read `tmp/session-state.md`** -- recover context from the prior session
3. **Read this document** -- understand all workflow rules
4. **Run `code_research` in ChunkHound** -- understand relevant existing code before making changes
5. **Read referenced docs** -- any documentation mentioned in the task description
6. **Then begin implementation** -- you now have full context to work without diverging from the plan

---

## Progress Log

**File: `PROGRESS.md` in project root**

The orchestrator MUST maintain a running progress log during overnight/extended sessions.

Format:

```markdown
## Session: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

### Completed
- [2.1] Added session persistence commands (commit abc1234)

### In Progress
- [2.5] Scanner dashboard -- 3/5 components implemented

### Blocked
- [2.2] Metrics store -- depends on 2.1 (now unblocked)

### Decisions Made
- 2.3: Used rusqlite instead of sqlx for simpler async-free SQLite access.

### Next Up
- [2.2] Metrics store (unblocked by 2.1 completion)
```

## Error Ownership

For the full error ownership policy, see `.orqa/rules/error-ownership.md`.

**Summary:** ALL errors are YOUR responsibility. No exceptions.

- Do NOT claim "this error existed before"
- Do NOT skip or ignore failures
- Do NOT commit with failing checks
- Pre-existing errors: fix them as part of your commit

---

## Integration Verification

Before calling ANY existing function, Tauri command, or store method:

1. Read the source -- check actual function signature
2. Check the types -- verify parameter names and types
3. Run `cargo clippy` and `npm run check` -- catch mismatches immediately

NO backwards compatibility shims. Fix ALL callers in the same commit. See `.orqa/rules/error-ownership.md`.

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [Coding Standards](/development/coding-standards) | Full code quality rules |
| [Architecture Decisions](/architecture/decisions) | All architecture decisions |
| [Team Overview](/process/team) | Agent directory, skill directory |
| [Definition of Ready](/process/definition-of-ready) | Task start gate checklist |

## Session Handoff

At session end, the orchestrator writes a handoff note to `tmp/session-state.md` (gitignored).

Template:

```markdown
## Session State -- [date]

### Current Phase
[Phase name from the active plan, or "No active plan"]

### Completed This Session
- [Bullet list of tasks/phases completed]

### Next Actions
- [What the next session should do first]

### Open Questions
- [Anything needing user input]

### Context Notes
- [Key decisions, findings, or constraints the next session needs]
- [Active worktrees, if any]
```
