# Governance Bootstrap

**Date:** 2026-03-04
**Phase:** 2b
**Status:** Design

## Overview

When a user opens a project in Forge, Claude (via the Agent SDK sidecar) scans existing governance files, analyzes their coverage and quality, and generates recommendations for improvements. The output is always native Claude Code artifacts — `.claude/rules/*.md`, `.claude/hooks/*.sh`, `.claude/agents/*.md`, `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md`.

The governance bootstrap is the bridge between "project has some governance" and "project has comprehensive, enforceable governance." It is Claude-powered because static analysis cannot understand intent, detect gaps in coverage, or generate contextually appropriate rules.

## Why Claude, Not a Static Scanner

A static scanner can count files and check formats. Claude can:

- **Read and understand** governance files — detect what a rule actually enforces vs. what it claims to
- **Detect gaps** — identify areas of the codebase with no governance coverage (e.g., testing standards exist but no error handling rules)
- **Suggest improvements** — generate rules, hooks, and agent definitions tailored to the project's tech stack and domain
- **Translate formats** — convert Cursor rules, Copilot instructions, or Continue configs into Claude Code artifacts
- **Generate tech-stack-specific content** — a Rust project gets different rules than a Python project

## Scan Sources

The governance scanner walks the filesystem to collect governance files from multiple tool ecosystems.

| Source | Path Pattern | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Claude rules | `.claude/rules/*.md` | Enforcement rules for Claude Code agents |
| Claude agents | `.claude/agents/*.md` | Agent role definitions |
| Claude skills | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill definitions |
| Claude hooks | `.claude/hooks/*` | Session hooks (bash scripts) |
| Claude settings | `.claude/settings.json` | Hook configuration, permissions |
| CLAUDE.md | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` or root `CLAUDE.md` | Project-level Claude instructions |
| AGENTS.md | Root `AGENTS.md` | Cross-agent instructions |
| Cursor rules | `.cursor/rules/*.md`, `.cursorrules` | Cursor AI rules (translatable) |
| Copilot instructions | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | GitHub Copilot instructions (translatable) |
| Continue config | `.continue/` | Continue IDE extension config (translatable) |

## Output: Native Artifacts Only

The governance bootstrap produces native Claude Code artifacts exclusively. It never creates Forge-specific files or proprietary formats. This means:

- Governance works in the CLI without Forge installed
- Users can edit artifacts with any text editor
- No vendor lock-in — the artifacts are the Claude Code standard

| Artifact Type | Output Path | Description |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| Rules | `.claude/rules/*.md` | Enforcement rules |
| Hooks | `.claude/hooks/*.sh` | Session and pre-commit hooks |
| Agents | `.claude/agents/*.md` | Agent role definitions |
| Skills | `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Skill definitions |
| Settings | `.claude/settings.json` | Hook registration and permissions |
| CLAUDE.md | `.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Project instructions |
| AGENTS.md | `AGENTS.md` | Cross-agent instructions |

## Sidecar Integration

The governance bootstrap uses the existing `send_message` flow with a dedicated "governance" session. No new sidecar request types are needed — it is a specialized system prompt that instructs Claude to analyze governance files and produce structured output.

**Flow:**
1. Rust backend collects governance files via filesystem walk
2. File contents are formatted into a structured prompt
3. A governance session is created with a system prompt instructing Claude to analyze and recommend
4. Claude's response is parsed into structured recommendations
5. Recommendations are stored in SQLite for review

The system prompt instructs Claude to return recommendations in a structured JSON format within a code block, which Rust parses into `Recommendation` objects.

## Wizard Flow

### Trigger Conditions

The governance bootstrap wizard appears when a project is opened and meets one of these conditions:

- **First open:** No governance analysis exists for this project in SQLite
- **Sparse governance:** The scan finds fewer than 3 governance areas covered (e.g., has rules but no agents, hooks, or skills)
- **Manual trigger:** User clicks "Re-analyze" on the project dashboard

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Project opens** — Rust backend automatically scans the filesystem for governance files
2. **Sparse detection** — If fewer than 3 governance areas have files, the wizard overlay appears
3. **Scan panel** — Displays findings: which files were found, which areas are covered, a coverage indicator (e.g., "3 of 7 areas covered")
4. **"Analyze with Claude"** — User clicks to start the Claude-powered analysis. Creates a governance session via the sidecar
5. **Analysis results** — Claude returns structured analysis: strengths, gaps, and recommendations. Displayed in a review panel
6. **Review panel** — Each recommendation is a card showing: category, priority, title, description, target file path, and content preview. User can approve, reject, or edit each recommendation
7. **Conversational refinement** — User can send follow-up messages in the governance session to refine recommendations (e.g., "Make that rule stricter" or "We don't use Playwright, use Vitest instead")
8. **Apply** — Approved recommendations are written to disk as native files. Forge calls `fs::write` for each approved artifact
9. **Done** — Dashboard updated with new governance health status

## User Journeys

**New project with no governance:**
1. User opens a project directory with no `.claude/` folder
2. Scan finds 0 governance files — wizard appears automatically
3. Scan panel shows "No governance files found. 0 of 7 areas covered."
4. User clicks "Analyze with Claude"
5. Claude analyzes the project's package.json, Cargo.toml, etc. to understand the tech stack
6. Claude generates recommendations: coding standards rule, error handling rule, testing rule, pre-commit hook, etc.
7. User reviews each recommendation — approves most, rejects one, edits another via chat
8. User clicks "Apply" — files written to `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/hooks/`, etc.
9. Dashboard shows governance health: "5 of 7 areas covered"

**Existing project with Cursor rules:**
1. User opens a project with `.cursorrules` and some `.cursor/rules/*.md`
2. Scan finds Cursor-format rules — wizard appears (Claude tools not configured)
3. Scan panel shows: "Found 4 Cursor rules. Claude Code governance: 0 of 7 areas covered."
4. User clicks "Analyze with Claude"
5. Claude reads the Cursor rules, understands their intent, and generates equivalent Claude Code rules
6. Recommendations include translated rules plus additional gap-filling suggestions
7. User reviews, approves, applies

**Existing project with comprehensive governance:**
1. User opens the Forge project itself (which has extensive `.claude/` governance)
2. Scan finds 20+ files across all 7 areas
3. Coverage is 7/7 — wizard does NOT auto-trigger
4. User can still click "Re-analyze" on the dashboard to get improvement suggestions

## Verification Criteria

1. **Scan accuracy:** Open a project with `.claude/` files — scan finds all files, coverage ratio is correct
2. **Sparse trigger:** Open a project with < 3 governance areas — wizard triggers automatically
3. **Claude analysis:** "Analyze with Claude" produces structured recommendations with real content (not stubs)
4. **Approve/reject:** Recommendation status changes persist in SQLite
5. **Apply writes files:** Approved recommendations create real files on disk at the specified paths
6. **Re-analyze detects changes:** After applying recommendations, re-scanning detects the new files

## Pillar Alignment

| Pillar | Alignment |
|--------|-----------|
| Self-Learning Loop | Governance bootstrap is the first turn of the learning loop — Claude reads what exists and improves it. Each re-analysis captures what changed and suggests further improvements, building knowledge over time. |
| Process Governance | Creates native Claude Code governance artifacts from scratch or by translating from other tools, making governance visible and enforceable from the moment a project is opened in Forge. |
