# Architecture Decisions

> Individual decision artifacts are in `.orqa/decisions/`. This page is a summary index.
> To add a new decision, create `AD-NNN.md` in `.orqa/decisions/` following the schema in
> `docs/product/artifact-framework.md`.

Architecture decisions for OrqaStudio™. Each decision is numbered AD-NNN and is immutable once recorded — it can only be superseded by a new decision. Superseded decisions remain in the log for historical context.

## How to Read This Table

- **Status: accepted** — the decision is active and must be followed
- **Status: superseded** — the decision has been replaced by a newer AD; see the artifact for which AD supersedes it
- **Artifact** — the canonical source of the full decision text: context, rationale, consequences, and implementation notes

## Adding a New Decision

1. Determine the next available ID by checking the highest existing AD number in `.orqa/decisions/`
2. Create `.orqa/decisions/AD-NNN.md` following the schema in `docs/product/artifact-framework.md`
3. Add a row to the Decision Log table above
4. If the new decision supersedes an existing one, update the superseded row's status to `superseded` and add a note in the superseded artifact linking to the new one

## Pillar Alignment

| Pillar | Alignment |
|--------|-----------|
| Clarity Through Structure | Architecture decisions make technical constraints visible and explicit — each decision is a structured artifact that communicates why the system is built the way it is and what it rules out. |
| Learning Through Reflection | N/A |
